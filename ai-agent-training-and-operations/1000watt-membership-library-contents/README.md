#### Making the Emotional Connection with Homesellers: Part One | 2025

Sellers are no longer just moving; they’re redefining who they are. But from the very first step, fear runs the show. Price panic. Timeline stress. Deal collapse dread. Most agents respond with credentials. Sellers want clarity.\

* Conversation-starter slides that shift focus from promises to process
* A seller stress map to anchor your presentations
* Tactics to build trust before you’re hired, including voice-note testimonials
* A seller interview guide to win the listing before it begins
