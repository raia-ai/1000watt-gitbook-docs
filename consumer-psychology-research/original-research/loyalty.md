# loyalty

## 06.2021

### Introduction

The real estate industry suffers from a **loyalty problem of epic, self-defeating proportions**. Conversely, this creates a massive opportunity for those who can break this pattern. We believe the future belongs to those who solve this problem and seize this opportunity.

NAR research has long shown that almost **90% of people are happy with their Realtor** after a transaction, would recommend them to others, and would use them for their next purchase or sale. However, this moment of good feeling is fleeting. Over time, the average Realtor gets just about **15% of their business from repeat clients or referrals**.

This chasm of disloyalty and failure of retention has been of tremendous consequence.

> Would Zillow, Trulia and Realtor.com have become the giants they are if agents and brokers had been more effective at retaining their clients? We doubt it.

We think the first step toward solving the loyalty problem is to gain an understanding of two things:

### What is currently happening and not happening with agent/client engagement post-transaction

Content and examples needed to understand current practices, gaps, and behaviors around post-transaction engagement.

### What people might in fact want from their real estate professional after escrow is closed

Understanding client desires for post-close services and support to guide retention strategies.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

We fielded a brief survey asking homeowners across the United States basic questions along these lines.

### Results and Analysis

#### Q1. Agent Satisfaction

We asked people if they were happy with their agent. **82% indicated they were either “very satisfied” or “satisfied.”** These responses align, broadly, with NAR’s findings over time. **Most people like their agent.**

| Answer                   | Answer (%) |
| ------------------------ | ---------- |
| Yes, very satisfied      | 36.92%     |
| Yes, satisfied           | 46.54%     |
| No, somewhat unsatisfied | 14.23%     |
| No, very unsatisfied     | 2.31%      |

#### Q2. Client-Initiated Post-Close Contact

We began our exploration of post-close engagement by asking people if they contacted their agent. Interestingly, almost **40% of people contacted their agent after closing**. This strikes us as a very good baseline: a lot of people seek out their agent. So far, so good. People are happy and reach out.

| Answer | Answer (%) |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Yes    | 39.23%     |
| No     | 60.77%     |

#### Q3. Why Clients Did Not Reach Out

Of those who did not reach out to their agent, **47% said it “didn’t occur to them”** and **22% stated they didn’t think their agent “had the knowledge to help outside a transaction.”**

> Clearly people’s conception of the agent or company that helped them is narrow and transactional.

This suggests that **defining your capabilities more broadly during the transaction may aid in client retention.**

| Answer                                                                    | Answer (%) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| If did not occur to me to ask                                             | 46.52%     |
| I don’t trust or value my agent’s opinion                                 | 11.71%     |
| I don’t think my agent has the knowledge to help outside of a transaction | 21.52%     |
| Other                                                                     | 20.25%     |

#### Q4. Purpose of Client Contact

Of those who did contact their agent:

* **43% wanted a recommendation for a service provider**.
* **38% wanted an update on their home’s value**.
* **13% wanted an opinion on an upgrade to their home**.

These track with expectations, but they suggest an **opportunity to systematize this knowledge proactively** from the agent or company side.

| Answer                                                                          | Answer (%) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Recommendation for a service provider (painter, plumber, roofer, etc.)          | 42.65%     |
| To get an update on my home’s value                                             | 37.75%     |
| To ask for an opinion on an upgrade to my home (new kitchen, landscaping, etc.) | 12.75%     |
| Other                                                                           | 6.86%      |

#### Q5. Agent-Initiated Post-Close Contact

When we asked people if their agent kept in touch with them post-transaction, **45% of respondents claim to have had no contact** with their agent (or were not impressed enough to recall such attempted contact) after the sale.

> New companies, with a systemized approach to client retention, will capitalize on this failure.

| Answer | Answer (%) |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Yes    | 54.23%     |
| No     | 45.77%     |

#### Q6. Methods of Contact

In-person contact (drop-by’s, phone calls, etc.), email, and snail mail are, predictably, the primary means. Social media accounted for most of the “other” responses.

The lack of better client loyalty and retention suggests that, for many agents, these tactics produce suboptimal results.

| Answer                                          | Answer (%) |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Personally (dropping by or calling)             | 35.82%     |
| Email (newsletters, home value updates, etc.)   | 46.10%     |
| Snail mail (postcards, promotional items, etc.) | 15.25%     |
| Other                                           | 2.84%      |

#### Q7. Value of Agent Outreach

The roughly half of people who report their agent staying in touch seem to find value in these communications. **26% find these contacts very valuable.**

| Answer            | Answer (%) |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| No, not at all    | 2.84%      |
| No, not really    | 18.79%     |
| Yes, somewhat     | 52.48%     |
| Yes, very much so | 25.89%     |

#### Q8. Most Desired Post-Transaction Service

We asked all respondents what they would want their agent to do for them outside the transaction.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Update me on the likely value of my home

36.15% indicated this as their top desire. While many agents do this obliquely, the execution is generally poor compared to the well-conceived updates delivered by Zillow, Redfin, and Realtor.com.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Alert me when it makes sense to refinance my mortgage

22.12% indicated this preference. Many agents cede this territory to loan officers, but this indicates a significant opportunity.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Full breakdown:

| Answer                                                 | Answer (%) |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Update me on the likely value of my home               | 36.15%     |
| Alert me when it makes sense to refinance my mortgage  | 22.12%     |
| Keep me abreast of neighborhood/community developments | 13.27%     |
| Alert me to recent home sale in my neighborhood        | 11.92%     |
| Give me home maintenance tips/recommendations          | 11.54%     |
| Other                                                  | 5.00%      |

### Conclusions and Possibilities

In short:

* People are generally happy with their agent.
* They welcome communication after the sale.
* Half of those who receive communication from their agent find some value in it.
* They aren’t always aware of the value an agent has outside a transaction.

It is clear there is a **disconnect between agents and their clients** that is contributing to the loyalty problem. Half of all respondents got no post-transaction communication from their agents — an abject fail.

The other piece of the puzzle is hard to place, but we do have some hypotheses:

* Agents and brokers frame their value too narrowly.
* Old “tried and true” sphere/follow-up/retention tactics are in reality “tried and tired.”
* A focus on online lead conversion may contribute to a short-term mindset that, eventually, leads to more... online leads (lost clients).

The Customer Contact Council concluded that **“...delighting customers doesn’t build loyalty; reducing their effort—the work they must do to get their problem solved—does.”**

We suspect solving the industry’s loyalty problem lies, quite simply, in **reducing the amount of effort people need to expend solving their own real estate problems**. Buyers and sellers want continued advice after the sale on topics that require effort:

* Finding home values.
* Knowing when to refinance.
* Locating service providers.
* Understanding potential returns on investments.

Helping people solve these problems and answer these questions more easily seems like a good place to begin for companies that want a sustainable advantage.
