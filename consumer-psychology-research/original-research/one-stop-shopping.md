# one stop shopping

**Homebuyer attitudes towards one-stop shopping for real estate, mortgage, and title/closing services**

**January 2022**

## Introduction

Real estate brokerage companies have pursued the "core services" business model — standing up mortgage, title, and insurance affiliates or joint ventures — for decades.

HomeServices of America grew into the #1 real estate brokerage holding company in America using this strategy.

Such "one-stop shopping" plays are not new, but they are more salient than ever.

### The Stakes Have Been Raised

{% step %}
### Brokerage profits have eroded

Some companies view the real estate transaction as a loss leader feeding profit centers in mortgage, title, and insurance.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Public companies need growth/profitability stories

More brokerages and franchisors are publicly traded (e.g., RE/MAX, Compass, EXP, Redfin) and need growth/profitability narratives.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Investment into proptech

A wave of investment is focused on building a better real estate consumer experience through service integration.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Non-bank lenders entering brokerage

Non-bank lenders like Rocket and Better are starting in-house discount real estate brokerages to feed their mortgage businesses.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

We wanted to know if consumers are on board for the ride.
