# consumer trust in real estate agents

**1000WATT Original Research: Consumer Trust**

## Introduction

For years, The Harris Poll has consistently placed real estate agents near the bottom of their list of trusted professions, often below attorneys and car salesmen. However, post-transaction surveys reveal a paradox: the majority of people express satisfaction with their agent and a willingness to use them again.

This discrepancy mirrors a similar trend in politics, where Americans hold a low regard for Congress yet re-elect their incumbents frequently due to the delivery of a "selective benefit." In real estate, this benefit is more nuanced.

While organizations like NAR and various state associations have conducted commendable research on home buyer and seller attitudes, survey research is not just about the answers; the questions asked (and not asked) are equally important. This research attempts to address some of the "unaskables."

The primary goal of this report is to draw **inferences** and make **recommendations** for marketing, communications, and branding based on the collected data.

## About the Survey and Sample

The survey was presented to **600 respondents** across the United States, all over the age of 25.

| Characteristic              | Detail                                             |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Sample Size                 | 600                                                |
| Geography                   | United States                                      |
| Age                         | Over 25                                            |
| Home Transaction Experience | Approximately 84% had bought or sold a home before |
| Gender Distribution         | 45% Male; 55% Female                               |

Note: This report refers to individuals who buy or sell real estate as "people," not "consumers." The latter term, while economically appropriate, tends to numb the sensitivity required for effective marketing.

## Analysis: What People Think About Agents

### The Trust Paradox

Most satisfaction surveys ask, "Would you use your agent again?" A "yes" from over 80% of respondents is the consistent result. However, this does not translate into actual client loyalty.

Our results suggest an explanation: **32%** of respondents who had bought or sold a home in the past ranked agents a **5 or lower on trustworthiness** (on a 1–10 scale). This underlying distrust seems to persist through direct real estate experiences and colors future choices.

We hypothesize that agents' perception of client satisfaction is often "softened" by the client's desire not to offend and the positive feelings associated with completing a transaction.

Recommendation: Soliciting feedback _during_ the transaction (e.g., "How are you feeling how things are going? Am I meeting your expectations?") may strengthen trust and increase long-term loyalty.

<summary>Q1. Trustworthiness of Real Estate Agents (Scale of 1-10)</summary>

The distribution of trustworthiness scores:

| Score (1 = Not Trustworthy, 10 = Very Trustworthy) | Count |
| :------------------------------------------------: | :---: |
|                          1                         |   11  |
|                          2                         |   11  |
|                          3                         |   20  |
|                          4                         |   23  |
|                          5                         |   49  |
|                          6                         |   54  |

|                          8                         |   80  |
|                          9                         |  137  |
|                         10                         |  148  |

### Reasons for Distrust

For respondents who scored agents **5 or below**, the reasons for distrust were examined.

| Rank | Reason                                                       | Percentage (%) |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------: |
| 1    | I think most agents lie                                      |     30.35%     |
| 2    | I know people who are agents and don’t find them trustworthy |     23.38%     |
| 3    | I think agents get paid too much                             |     22.39%     |
| 4    | I think most agents are unprofessional                       |      7.96%     |
| 5    | Other                                                        |     15.92%     |

The third-ranked reason—"I know people who are agents and don’t find them trustworthy"—is particularly interesting, beating out "unprofessional." This suggests a **social effect** or collateral damage from the sheer volume of agents (\~1.45 million NAR members) who are friends, neighbors, or acquaintances.

Two recurring respondent comments were instructive:

* "I just don’t trust the process"
* "I think they try to sell you houses that they want to sell, rather than listening to what you want."

Recommendation: Both objections can be preempted by **clear and thorough communication** at the beginning of a client relationship. Distrust thrives in information-poor contexts. Early transparency is a likely antidote to the sentiment that agents steer people to houses they want to sell, especially in light of the recent DOJ/NAR settlement.

### Reasons for Trust

For people who rated agent trustworthiness **6 or above**, the social effect again came into play.

| Rank | Reason                                             | Percentage (%) |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------- | :------------: |
| 1    | I know good people who are real estate agents      |     57.91%     |
| 2    | My personal experience                             |     26.54%     |
| 3    | I am able to see customer reviews of agents online |     15.01%     |
| 4    | Other                                              |      0.54%     |

Key Finding: The perception of the group is shaped by knowing a lot of real estate agents (beyond their own agent). Surprisingly, **online reviews** were cited by 15% as a contributing factor.

### How Agents Win Trust

When people who had bought or sold were asked what went the furthest to earn their trust, the results were clear.

| Rank | Factor                         | Percentage (%) |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | :------------: |
| 1    | **Open, honest communication** |   **48.61%**   |
| 2    | Good listening skills          |     13.76%     |
| 3    | Good negotiating skills        |     12.54%     |
| 4    | None of the above              |     13.07%     |
| 5    | They did not win my trust      |      9.76%     |
| 6    | Other                          |      2.26%     |

Conclusion: While negotiating skill is often identified as the most valued attribute, **trust precedes and conditions everything else**, and trust is cemented with communication.

### The Effect of Real Estate Reality Shows

The effect of real estate reality shows and the "celebrity agent" phenomenon on public perception was explored.

| Question                                        | Answer | Percentage (%) |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------ | :------------: |
| Do you watch “reality” shows about real estate? | Yes    |     62.37%     |
|                                                 | No     |     37.63%     |

| Question                                                                           | Answer            | Percentage (%) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | :------------: |
| Do these shows make you feel more trusting or less trusting of real estate agents? | More trusting     |     35.20%     |
|                                                                                    | Less trusting     |     20.39%     |
|                                                                                    | No impact         |     43.85%     |
|                                                                                    | None of the above |      0.56%     |

Conclusion: A majority of people watch these shows, and among those affected, the result is a net increase in trust (**35.20% More trusting** vs. **20.39% Less trusting**). This is considered a "win."

### Agent Compensation

Respondents were asked about their perception of agent compensation.

| Question                                        | Answer      | Percentage (%) |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------- | :------------: |
| Generally, I think real estate agents are paid: | About right |     56.80%     |
|                                                 | Too much    |     34.40%     |
|                                                 | Too little  |      8.80%     |

Interpretation: While 34.40% thinking agents are overpaid is not ideal, the fact that **56.80%** responded "**About right**" and **8.80%** responded "**Too little**" is perhaps not as bad as it seems, especially considering the decline in average commission rates.

## Analysis: What People Know About Agents

Understanding what prospective customers know (and don't know) about the real estate world is a critical starting point.

### Knowledge of Agent Compensation

In light of the DOJ action aimed at increasing transparency in how buyer's agents are paid, knowledge of agent compensation was assessed. Overall, understanding is "fuzzy."

<details>

<summary>Q8. Do you know how real estate agents get paid? (Non-Home Buyers)</summary>

| Answer                                      | Percentage (%) |
| ------------------------------------------- | :------------: |
| Yes, I know how real estate agents get paid |     41.81%     |
| Sort of, generally speaking                 |     44.08%     |
| No idea                                     |     14.11%     |

</details>

<details>

<summary>Q8. Do you know how real estate agents get paid? (Home Buyers)</summary>

| Answer                                      | Percentage (%) |
| ------------------------------------------- | :------------: |
| Yes, I know how real estate agents get paid |     45.80%     |
| Sort of, generally speaking                 |     43.80%     |
| No idea                                     |     10.40%     |

</details>

Key Finding: Even among those who had bought or sold in the past, **10.4% still had "no idea."**

Recommendation: A clear, open, and thorough discussion of compensation with clients—or proactively through marketing—is an opportunity to provide context and build trust.

### Agent vs. Broker Knowledge

Directly related to compensation is the agent/broker relationship.

<details>

<summary>Q9. Do you know the difference between a real estate agent and real estate broker?</summary>

| Answer          | Percentage (%) |
| --------------- | :------------: |
| No, not really  |     40.80%     |
| Yes, kind of    |     28.40%     |
| Yes, definitely |     16.80%     |
| No, no idea     |     14.00%     |

</details>

Conclusion: Most people do not know the difference, with only a small difference between those who have and have not transacted. This presents another **opportunity for communication**.

### Brokerage Brand Influence

Despite the lack of understanding of the broker/agent relationship, people who have transacted do value a brokerage brand.

<details>

<summary>Q10. Did the company or brand your agent was affiliated with influence your decision to choose your agent?</summary>

| Answer                                                               | Percentage (%) |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------: |
| No, not really                                                       |     32.05%     |
| Yes, it made me more comfortable with my decision                    |     33.65%     |
| No, no at all                                                        |     21.15%     |
| Yes, I chose my agent because of the company or brand they were with |     13.14%     |

</details>

Key Finding: **46.79%** (33.65% + 13.14%) were influenced by the brand. This is useful for retention and recruiting messaging for companies with well-regarded brands.

However, things change post-transaction. Of those who have bought or sold, **37.60% could not remember** the brokerage their agent worked with.

<details>

<summary>Q11. Do you remember the company or brand your real estate agent was affiliated with?</summary>

| Answer             | Percentage (%) |
| ------------------ | :------------: |
| Yes, I remember    |     62.40%     |
| No, can’t remember |     37.60%     |

</details>

### REALTOR® vs. Real Estate Agent

The NAR spends significant resources reinforcing the distinction between a REALTOR® and a non-member real estate agent/licensee.

<details>

<summary>Q12. Is there a difference between a REALTOR® and a real estate agent?</summary>

| Answer                         | Percentage (%) |
| ------------------------------ | :------------: |
| Yes, they are different things |     47.40%     |
| I have no idea                 |     38.80%     |
| No, they are the same thing    |     13.80%     |

</details>

Conclusion: **52.6%** (38.80% + 13.80%) either believe there is no difference or have no idea.

<details>

<summary>Q13. How are REALTORS® different than real estate agents? (Asked to those who believe there is a difference)</summary>

| Answer                                                        | Percentage (%) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------: |
| REALTORS® are members of the national association of Realtors |     48.68%     |
| REALTORS® are affiliated with a specific company              |     32.45%     |
| REALTORS® have more experience and training                   |     18.87%     |

</details>

Key Finding: Less than half of those who believe there is a difference get the correct answer (membership in NAR). Overall, less than **25%** of all respondents had a basic understanding of the distinction.

Recommendation: This suggests significant opportunity for individual REALTORS® to explain the value of their membership.
