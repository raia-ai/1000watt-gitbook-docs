# millennial renters and homeownership research

_A research report by 1000watt, published August 2021._

## Introduction

We have been subjected to generalizations and conference panel soundbites about the Millennial generation for years now. We hear that this cohort is tech-obsessed, that they expect “on demand” everything, that they crave “authenticity.” OK, maybe.

We wanted to go beyond the facile assumptions and hype to get a firmer grasp on how people aged 25-40 think about homeownership and the professionals who might help them achieve it. So we asked them directly. Some of the results were surprising. More importantly, the responses outlined some clear industry opportunities.

Millennials are the largest population group in the US, with an estimated population of 72 million. Together, they spend $600 billion dollars in the US each year. It’s critical that we understand their approach to real estate, as this will be our core demographic of buyers and sellers for years to come.

## About Our Survey

We fielded a survey of **600 people** between the ages of 25-40 across the United States. 50% of respondents were male; 50% were female.

* **77%** of respondents rent their own house or apartment.
* **23%** live with family or relatives and pay rent.

***

## Executive Summary

A resounding **9 out of 10 respondents want to own a home**. The pandemic has strengthened this resolve.

Many are driven primarily by financial or rational considerations, but slightly over 50% are driven by what we might call “emotional” considerations. One respondent’s explanation of his desire to own a home as “a great taste of independence and happiness in life” captured this nicely.

Millennial renters pay attention to the market, regularly look at homes online (**60% do so more than once per week**), and have opinions about why and how they might make future home-buying decisions.

* **57%** are able to work remotely.
* **40%** are willing to relocate to find a home they can afford.
* **31%** would buy a home without seeing it in person.

These things paint a positive picture: a massive cohort entering prime homebuying age with high intent that is untethered by geography, and willing to buy sight-unseen.

But it’s not all good news. Millennial renters are also well aware of the potential roadblocks they are facing. Existing debt, low inventory, rising prices, and an inherent lack of trust or understanding about the role of the agent all play a part in how they think about their real estate future. Climate change impacts how close to half of respondents think about buying a home.

## Results and Analysis

### Desire and Market Awareness

We started with the obvious. Do you want to buy a home? An overwhelming **91% said yes**.

| Q1: Do you want to buy a home at some point in the future? | Answer (%) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Yes                                                        | 91.17%     |
| No/Unsure                                                  | 8.83%      |

Of the 9% that said no, the majority attributed that to the price of homes and their existing debt. One respondent elaborated with, “I don’t think it’s a reasonable goal anymore.”

| Q2: Why not?                                              | Answer (%) |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Homes are too expensive                                   | 33.82%     |
| I have too much debt already and don’t want to add more   | 27.94%     |
| I don’t want to tie myself down to living in one location | 14.71%     |
| I don’t think it’s a good investment                      | 11.76%     |
| Other                                                     | 11.76%     |

We then asked those who do want to purchase, “what is the primary reason you want to own a home?” The results were pretty evenly split between financial and emotional benefits. Clearly, buying a home remains a means of self-actualization for many. The **“dream” of homeownership remains vivid** for younger people. 'Other' answers mentioned safety from evictions by landlords.

| Q3: What is the primary reason you want to own a home?                                        | Answer (%) |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Emotional/lifestyle reasons – pride of ownership, a place for me/my family to call home, etc. | 51.19%     |
| Financial/rational reasons – buying a home is a good investment and builds wealth             | 47.17%     |
| Other                                                                                         | 1.65%      |

When asked about timing, **1 in 3 respondents** who desire to buy a home said they’d like to buy as soon as possible, with a further 47% of respondents wanting to purchase within the next three years. Only 24% had a time horizon over 3 years.

| Q4: When do you want/plan to buy a home? | Answer (%) |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 1-3 years                                | 46.62%     |
| ASAP                                     | 29.07%     |
| 3+ years                                 | 24.31%     |

We then asked an open-ended question: “What have you heard lately about real estate?” The answers were extremely varied, but there were some interesting patterns.

* **59%** said some version of “The market is hot / overpriced or too expensive / inventory is low / now is not a good time to buy.” Many of these comments reflected beliefs that this inventory shortage or price spike may be related to the pandemic.
* **21%** said they heard nothing in particular.
* **10%** said some version of “The market is down, it’s a good time to buy.”
* **6%** mentioned a real estate bubble.

Several comments referenced corporations buying up homes and raising rental prices, or pushing first-time buyers out of the market. Interestingly, while a large number of responses showed an awareness of the sellers’ market, almost none mentioned low interest rates. In fact, several people referenced high interest rates, which corresponds to a small uptick in rates at the time of this survey. It is worth noting that this age group has lived all or most of their adult lives in an era of historically cheap money.

### Obstacles and New Considerations (Climate Change, the Pandemic, and a New Mobility)

What stands between Millennials and their strong desire to own a home? And how have the pandemic and the growing manifestations of climate change conditioned their thinking about real estate?

When asked what their biggest obstacle to buying a home is, more than half of the respondents don't have the downpayment needed. Many have doubts about qualifying for a mortgage, have existing debt loads, or have uncertain employment situations.

| Q5: What is the biggest thing holding you back from buying right now?       | Answer (%) |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| I don’t have enough money saved for a down payment                          | 26.51%     |
| I think home prices are too high right now and will fall in the near future | 23.49%     |
| I don’t think I could qualify for a mortgage                                | 16.88%     |
| I need to pay down other loans (car, student) first                         | 15.53%     |
| My work situation is uncertain                                              | 12.26%     |
| Political/social conflict or uncertainty                                    | 3.50%      |
| Other                                                                       | 1.83%      |

Extreme heat, drought, sea-level rise, flooding, and other effects of climate change are becoming more common. We wanted to see if younger people factored this into how they think about buying a home right now. **52% of people say it is having an impact**, with nearly a quarter indicating that it is impacting how they think about homeownership **a lot**.

| Q6: Is climate change impacting how you think about homeownership? | Answer (%) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Yes, somewhat                                                      | 29.17%     |
| No, not really                                                     | 31.00%     |
| Yes, a lot                                                         | 23.00%     |
| No, not at all                                                     | 16.83%     |

When asked whether climate change makes homeownership more or less attractive, **41% said it is less or somewhat less attractive**. 37% said it is more attractive, and most of the 20% of ‘other respondents’ said it made little difference.

| Q7: Does climate change make buying a home more or less attractive to you? | Answer (%) |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Somewhat less attractive                                                   | 34.83%     |
| Somewhat more attractive                                                   | 25.33%     |
| Other                                                                      | 20.50%     |
| A lot more attractive                                                      | 11.83%     |
| A lot less attractive                                                      | 7.50%      |

It is clear that climate change has entered peoples’ housing calculations. People will want, and need, guidance in this area.

#### The Pandemic's Impact

Has the pandemic changed how younger renters think at a high level about homeownership? **63% say yes**.

| Q8: Has the pandemic changed how you think about homeownership? | Answer (%) |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Yes, somewhat                                                   | 39.67%     |
| No, not really                                                  | 23.67%     |
| Yes, a lot                                                      | 23.17%     |
| No, not at all                                                  | 13.50%     |

**55% say it has become more attractive**, while 36% say it’s made homeownership less attractive.

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Somewhat more attractive                                                | 34.67%     |
| Somewhat less attractive                                                | 25.83%     |
| A lot more attractive                                                   | 19.83%     |
| A lot less attractive                                                   | 10.33%     |
| Other                                                                   | 9.33%      |

How did the respondents feel about buying a home they hadn’t actually set foot in? **Nearly 31% said they definitely would**, and roughly the same number would if a physical tour were not possible. Only 1 in 6 respondents said they definitely would not.

| Q12: Would you ever consider buying a home without physically touring it, using photos/videos/3-D tours instead? | Answer (%) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Maybe, if a physical tour were not possible                                                                      | 32.50%     |
| Yes, I would                                                                                                     | 31.17%     |

What features are they searching for? **Outdoor space**, **garage**, and **office space** are at the top of the list. 'Other' answers included closet space, nice kitchens, open layouts, and lots of windows.

| Q13: What feature would be a must have in your home? | Answer (%) |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |

Overall, what we see here is a cohort of buyers who are **mobile**, **climate change-conscious**, willing to accept a **virtual home shopping experience**, and **actively engaged** with real estate online.

### Perceptions of Real Estate Agents

According to NAR, the median age of its Realtor members is 57. That’s 17 years older than the oldest Millennial. Our survey group responses call into question much of the specious guidance on how older people should connect with younger people.

**33% of Millennials indicated that their general impression of agents was favorable**, 57% said their impression was neutral, and only 9% said they had an unfavorable impression of agents. Notably, Millennials appear to view agents more favorably than adults between 25 and 65 as a whole.

| Q15: What is your general impression of real estate agents? | Answer (%) |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Neutral                                                     | 57.33%     |
| Favorable                                                   | 33.00%     |
| Unfavorable                                                 | 9.67%      |

We asked those who responded “unfavorable” to elaborate:

| Q16: Why is your impression of real estate agents unfavorable? | Answer (%) |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Many seem sleazy/salesy                                        | 43.53%     |
| I think they charge too much for their services                | 42.35%     |
| I don’t think they understand people my age                    | 8.24%      |
| I don’t think they understand technology                       | 3.53%      |
| Other                                                          | 2.35%      |

Only **8% attributed this impression to a generational disconnect**.

And what might make these “unfavorables” change their impression? This open-ended question received some interesting responses.

* Many said **nothing** would make them change their mind.
* Several said **lower fees** might help.
* Most mentioned **honesty and transparency**.
* Quite a few said a **personal relationship** with an agent or a **referral from a friend** would change their mind.

<summary>Other comments included (verbatim examples)</summary>

> “Talking to one that doesn’t make buying a house seem like a hopeless dream for people my age.”\
> “Not sure there is anything. But it may help if they were to be more customer service focused and less commission focused.”\
> “If costs were transparent and understandable beforehand and lower, basically more standardized. And if their main goal was to get you the best house and price and work actively for you and not them.”\
> “If they prove I’m getting the lowest possible price and they disclose truthfully how much they’re making off the transaction.”

Speaking of compensation, only **2 out of 3 respondents say they know or understand how an agent gets paid**.

| Q17: Do you know how real estate agents are paid? | Answer (%) |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Yes                                               | 64.50%     |
| No                                                | 35.50%     |

When asked if they know the difference between a real estate agent and a Realtor, **most (57%) said no**.

| Q18: Do you know the difference between a real estate agent and a Realtor? | Answer (%) |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| No                                                                         | 56.67%     |
| Yes                                                                        | 43.33%     |

When we explained the difference to them and asked for their reaction to the distinction:

> “A real estate agent is licensed by the state in which they operate after passing an exam. A Realtor is a real estate agent who is also a member of the National Association of Realtors and subscribes to their association’s code of ethics.”

**44% said they definitely would choose a Realtor**, 22% didn’t understand the difference, and 31% found little significance in the difference.

| Q19: What is your reaction to the distinction between a Real Estate Agent and a Realtor? | Answer (%) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| I definitely want to work with a Realtor                                                 | 43.67%     |
| The difference doesn’t seem significant or important to me                               | 31.00%     |
| I don’t really understand the difference between a real estate agent and a Realtor       | 22.50%     |
| Other                                                                                    | 2.83%      |

What matters most when hiring an agent? Most respondents (Content truncated from original PDF, final question table is missing. Based on the previous structure, the final table would be Q20: What matters most when hiring an agent?) The final page only contained "Other 2.17% respondents would". I will conclude the document here.
