## Introduction

In October 2021, 1000WATT conducted a poll of 640 agents across North America, asking, "If you could snap your fingers and make the MLS disappear, would you?" The results showed a strong industry value for the MLS, with **89.9% saying no** and only 10.1% saying yes.

This research paper explores the public's understanding of the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) and its associated system of cooperation and compensation, particularly concerning buyer commissions. The study aims to understand consumer awareness, perception of benefits, and preferences regarding agent compensation.

## About the Survey

The primary survey was fielded to **600 homeowners** over the age of 25, living in the United States, who had bought or sold real estate in the past 3 years. The respondent pool was 54% male and 46% female.

## Results and Analysis: Awareness

### What do they think of first when they think of “MLS”?

When asked what they think of first when they think of "MLS," the results indicate that the term is not universally understood to mean the Multiple Listing Service.

| Answer                   | Percentage (%) |
| ------------------------ | -------------- |
| Multiple Listing Service | 47.00%         |
| Major League Soccer      | 37.33%         |
| Nothing                  | 8.83%          |
| Other                    | 6.83%          |

The analysis suggests that nearly half of the respondents think of the Multiple Listing Service, but "Major League Soccer" is a close second. The authors recommend using "Multiple Listing Service" instead of its acronym in consumer-facing contexts.

### Familiarity with the MLS

A significant portion of homeowners who have recently bought or sold a home are unclear about the function of the MLS.

| Answer                                            | Percentage (%) |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Yes, I understand what it is                      | 44.17%         |
| Vaguely — it has something to do with real estate | 37.83%         |
| No idea                                           | 18.00%         |

Almost **one-fifth (18.00%)** of respondents had "no idea" what the Multiple Listing Service does, suggesting that many agents are not communicating about the MLS with their clients.

### Perceived Benefits of the MLS

Respondents were asked how the MLS benefits both sellers and buyers.

Seller Benefits (Q3):

| Answer             | Percentage (%) |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Greater exposure   | 46.17%         |
| Better sales price | 26.83%         |
| Legal protection   | 14.17%         |
| No idea            | 12.83%         |

Most respondents believe that the MLS provides **greater exposure** to sellers.

Buyer Benefits (Q4):

| Answer                       | Percentage (%) |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| Access to all homes for sale | 43.00%         |
| More data                    | 29.83%         |
| Legal protection             | 14.00%         |
| No idea                      | 13.17%         |

The majority of those with awareness understand that the MLS provides buyers with **access to all homes for sale**.

### The Allure of "Exclusive" Listings

When presented with three hypothetical agent listing strategy pitches, nearly half of the respondents still chose the MLS-inclusive option, but a significant portion preferred the "exclusive" route.

| Agent Pitch (Q5)                                                                                                                                           | Percentage (%) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| "I will put it on our company’s website, put it on Zillow, and put it on the MLS, where every agent in the market working with active buyers will see it.” | 48.00%         |
| “I will put it on my company’s website, promote it to my database and other agents, and present your home as an ‘exclusive’ or ‘coming soon’ property.”    | 33.67%         |
| “I will put it on our company’s website and also place it on Zillow.”                                                                                      | 18.33%         |

The analysis concludes that **"exclusive" seduces** consumers, as people think their homes are special and respond to the marketing hook. This finding provides "fodder for those who are opposed to compelling agents to place listings on the MLS."

## The Third Rail: Commissions

The research delved into the contentious issue of buyer agent compensation, which is facing challenges in courts and from regulators.

### Understanding of Buyer Agent Compensation

Less than half of buyers fully understood how their agent was compensated.

| Answer (Q6)                    | Percentage (%) |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Yes, I understood this clearly | 46.17%         |
| Yes, I had a general idea      | 32.17%         |
| No, it was unclear to me       | 12.83%         |
| I had no idea                  | 8.83%          |

**54%** of respondents had either a vague idea or no idea at all, suggesting an **opacity** that could support calls to end the offer of compensation.

Furthermore, only about half of the agents clearly explained their compensation:

| Answer (Q7)                    | Percentage (%) |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Yes, they explained it clearly | 51.50%         |
| Yes, they described it vaguely | 28.00%         |
| No, they did not explain this  | 20.50%         |

### Who Pays the Fee?

When asked who they felt paid the buyer's agent fee, over half of the buyers felt they were the ones paying.

| Answer (Q8)                           | Percentage (%) |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **I felt like I paid their fee**      | **55.00%**     |
| I felt like the seller paid their fee | 34.50%         |
| Unsure                                | 10.50%         |

The authors note that this breakdown is likely significantly different from what a survey of buyer's agents would show, as agents typically point out that the commission is a portion of the fee paid by the seller. The bottom line is that **over half of buyers think they are paying**.

### Conclusion Drawn from the Commission Arrangement

Respondents were asked for their conclusion on the typical commission arrangement (2%-3% of sale price, set by the seller).

| Answer (Q9)                                                              | Percentage (%) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| The buyer really pays nothing for the services their agent provides      | 55.33%         |
| The buyer is forced to pay a fee they did not have a chance to negotiate | 30.50%         |
| Other                                                                    | 14.17%         |

The finding that **30.50%** feel they were "forced to pay a fee they did not have a chance to negotiate" is a critical point.

### Preferred Compensation Model

Given a choice between the current commission model and an hourly rate, a significant minority preferred the hourly rate.

| Compensation Option (Q10)                                                                                                                                        | Percentage (%) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Have your agent get paid a commission of 2.5% of the total purchase price you pay, paid at the close of the transaction from the money you used to buy the house | 56.67%         |
| Pay your agent an hourly rate of $200/hour, like a lawyer, before your transaction closes                                                                        | **43.33%**     |

The fact that **43%** would prefer to pay an hourly rate is a **powerful finding** for those who wish to decouple agent commissions.

### Perception of Commission Amount

Finally, respondents were asked for their opinion on a 5% commission split between agents on a $500,000 home ($12,500 per agent).

| Answer (Q11)                                | Percentage (%) |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Seems fair                                  | 46.50%         |
| **Seems like the agents get paid too much** | **39.17%**     |
| Seems like the agent get paid too little    | 14.33%         |

The authors suggest that if a significant number of buyers do not understand how their agent is paid and do not think they are the ones doing the paying, then attaching a number like **$12,500** to an agent’s compensation seems high, leading to the "paid too much" sentiment.

## Results and Analysis: Self-Diagnosis (What Agents Think)

A follow-up poll was sent to the group of 640 agents on the topic of **commission steering**.

### Do properties with a higher co-broke commission sell for more money?

| Agent Poll (Q1) | Percentage (%) |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| No              | 62.5%          |
| Yes             | 37.5%          |

### Do agents feel they might be more likely to show a property that has a higher co-broke commission?

| Agent Poll (Q2) | Percentage (%) |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| **Yes**         | **76.3%**      |
| No              | 23.8%          |

A large majority of agents (76.3%) admitted they might be more likely to show a property with a higher co-broke commission.

<summary>Agent commentary on commission steering (expand for more)</summary>

The report included agent commentary on commission steering, noting that while agents may not discriminate and show homes with a higher commission _over_ a typical fee split, there is "a lot of resistance over homes priced **below the typical split**." One agent noted, "There is a floor at which agents balk at showing homes."

## Conclusion

The results of this research can be interpreted in various ways, but the authors highlight a few clear takeaways:

* People don’t really understand what the MLS is or does.
* A lot of buyers don’t truly understand how their agent is paid.
* A surprising number of people (**43%**) say they would prefer to pay a buyer’s agent by the hour, rather than through a commission established by the seller.
* The idea of an **“exclusive” listing** is very enticing to people.

The authors conclude that the discussion about the MLS, cooperation, and compensation is certain to intensify in the coming months and years.
