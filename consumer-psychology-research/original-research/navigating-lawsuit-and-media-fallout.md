# navigating lawsuit and media fallout

## Introduction

In early October of last year, we surveyed 1,000 recent home buyers to understand their knowledge of how their buyer agent was paid, what they valued most from their agent, and their feelings about the compensation amount.

Two weeks later, a jury in Kansas City decided that the National Association of Realtors and several large real estate companies had systematically defrauded American consumers. This verdict, delivered on Halloween after just one hour of deliberation, triggered dozens of copycat lawsuits and a wave of uniformly unfavorable media stories from a real estate industry standpoint. Never before has the structure of the residential real estate industry been so directly and so widely challenged.

## About Our Latest Survey and Survey Respondents

We conducted this follow-up survey in late December 2023 to understand how the lawsuit verdict and media coverage were landing with consumers.

| Characteristic           | Percentage |
| ------------------------ | ---------- |
| **Female**               | 45%        |
| **Male**                 | 55%        |
| **Owned their own home** | 79%        |

The survey screened out real estate agents, real estate brokers, real estate investors, and people who work in the title, closing, and mortgage industries. All respondents confirmed they had heard or read about the recent class-action lawsuit verdict against the National Association of Realtors and several large real estate companies.

## Topline Findings and Takeaways

### Understanding of the Issue

Most people claim to have a good understanding of what happened:

* **30%** of respondents who had heard about the issue indicated they understand it **"very clearly."**
* **49%** said they had a **"general idea"** of what the issue at trial was.
* Only **21%** reported that **"I can’t recall the specifics, I just heard about it."**

### Increased Negative Perception and Questioning of Value

People aware of the trial and verdict are now more inclined to view the industry negatively and question agents’ value.

| Statement                                                                                                                   | Average Response (1-10 Scale) | % Selecting 8 or Higher |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| The recent lawsuits in the real estate industry have made my opinion or perception of real estate agents **more negative**. | 6.6                           | 34%                     |
| The recent lawsuits in the real estate industry have made me **question the value of real estate agents**.                  | 6.9                           | 39%                     |

This suggests that consumers are not liking what they are seeing and hearing about the real estate industry, presenting agents and brokers with a clear and present challenge.

### Alignment with Plaintiff's Argument

When asked about their opinion on the issue and outcome of the trial, respondents largely aligned with views sympathetic to the plaintiff's argument.

| Statement                                                                                                                                                                                   | All Respondents |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| The National Association of Realtors and big real estate companies are finally facing consequences for ripping off home buyers and sellers with excessive commissions/fees. (Pro-Plaintiff) | **40%**         |
| Real estate agents who work with buyers will now have to negotiate how they are compensated directly with those buyer clients, and this makes sense to me. (Neutral/Reform)                 | **49%**         |
| Real estate agents are being attacked wrongly, and this trial verdict was wrong. (Pro-Industry)                                                                                             | **10%**         |

The industry has lost the first battle in the communications war, as the plaintiff’s attorneys have effectively controlled the narrative.

### Anti-Industry Sentiment is Highest Among Younger Consumers

Anti-industry sentiment is most prevalent among younger consumers (aged 25-34).

| Statement                                                                                                                                                                                   | Respondents Aged 25-34 | Respondents Aged 54+ |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| The National Association of Realtors and big real estate companies are finally facing consequences for ripping off home buyers and sellers with excessive commissions/fees. (Pro-Plaintiff) | **49%**                | **30%**              |
| Real estate agents who work with buyers will now have to negotiate how they are compensated directly with those buyer clients, and this makes sense to me. (Neutral/Reform)                 | **43%**                | **43%**              |
| Real estate agents are being attacked wrongly, and this trial verdict was wrong. (Pro-Industry)                                                                                             | **8%**                 | **27%**              |

This highlights a significant challenge in connecting with those now entering prime buying age, a challenge that will not "age out" of the marketplace.

### Representative Comments from Respondents

A selection of comments from respondents who expressed negative sentiment:

* "2.5% can add up to a lot of money depending on the selling price. Sometimes they do a lot of extra work and sometimes it's a simple process, so I think the fee should depend on how much work the real estate agent did."
* "The selling agent does most of the work. The buyer's agent doesn’t really do much but gets paid the same amount as the selling agent."
* "Those people who make less than the national average income also dream of owning a home one day, but the realtor gets that percentage no matter how much work they do or don't do to close a sale. They can make more commission selling one house than many can make in one year, which could essentially stop some people from being able to purchase a home."
* "Home prices are quite high in most of the US. Realtors have profits from this, and it seems like the seller and buyer lose out in the end."
* "I think they should be paid on a fixed fee, not a percentage."
* "It only takes about 8 weeks to be a licensed real estate agent. Prices of homes are about 40% higher than pre-covid, which means they're making almost 40% more in commissions. Who else has that kind of pay raise for doing very little work?"
* "Because most of them don’t DO anything, and are unprofessional."
* "In general, I think that agents should get paid a decent salary with bonuses for sales rather than the commission-only model that is now used."
* "Because in this day and age everything can be done online or by yourself."

### Willingness to Pay for Buyer Agent Services

When asked how much they would be willing to pay a real estate agent to help guide them through a $500,000 home purchase, **57% responded $10,000 or above**.

| Amount Willing to Pay (for a $500k home) | Percentage |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **$15,000**                              | 5%         |
| **$12,500**                              | 15%        |
| **$10,000**                              | 37%        |
| **$7,500**                               | 17%        |
| **$5,000**                               | 14%        |
| **$2,500**                               | 12%        |

This suggests that most consumers are willing to pay a buyer agent well for their work, but the issue lies in either the agent's value not being fully perceived/understood (a marketing and communications problem) or the large number of unskilled agents failing to deliver value (a problem of failed strategy and twisted incentives).

### Personal Connections and the "Firewall"

* **50%** of all respondents know six or more agents personally.
* **20%** know at least eleven.

These personal connections skew results in a more industry-friendly direction. Those who knew at least eleven agents were almost **40% less likely** to align with the plaintiff’s point of view. The survey results suggest that the current media narrative is testing this "firewall" of personal connections that has historically protected the real estate industry.

### Online Search vs. Agent Value

The idea that one can search homes for sale online without an agent leads some to question the need for a buyer agent.

| Statement                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Percentage |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| It really isn’t necessary to hire a real estate agent to help you buy a home because all the homes for sale are online and you can just work with the agent who is selling the home (the “listing” agent). | **30%**    |
| It is worth paying a real estate agent to help you buy a home because it is a big, complex purchase requiring the expert guidance of a professional.                                                       | **70%**    |

For the **30%** who believe an agent is not necessary, the primary reasons were:

* **45%**: "Because I can find homes for sale myself online, and tour them at open houses."
* **38%**: "Because it seems simpler to me to just work with the agent representing the seller."
* **16%**: "Because I don’t think what real estate agents do is hard, and am confident I can do it myself."

### Due Diligence is Most Valued

When asked what they might value from a buyer agent, due diligence was the most important factor.

| Statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Percentage |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| A real estate agent who works for buyers can often get a better deal from the seller and their agent. (Price Negotiation)                                                                                                  | **21%**    |
| A real estate agent can find houses for sale that you might not see online. (Access to Listings)                                                                                                                           | **25%**    |
| A real estate agent can help buyers make smarter decisions by looking at the pros and cons of a home, translating inspection and disclosure reports, or interpreting fine print in the paperwork. (Due Diligence/Guidance) | **55%**    |

Respondents valued due diligence and guidance by a two-to-one margin over both price negotiation and access to offline listings.
