**What prospective sellers are thinking now**

**October 2022**

***

## Introduction

Current market conditions are, in a word, tough.

The era of dirt-cheap money ended abruptly, causing many buyers and sellers to call a time-out. Others are proceeding with anachronistic expectations, with, as one pundit put it, "sellers thinking it's last year, and buyers thinking it's next year".

The result is a sluggish and surly market.

In this report, we seek to gain insights on the cadre of prospective sellers who are actively considering selling, but not yet acting.

It is worth reporting the obvious here, because the obvious can often become occluded by the glut of noise. We asked our survey respondents who have a mortgage on their current home what the rate on that mortgage was. The answers explain nearly all you need to know about today's market:

### Current Mortgage Rates

**What is the approximate interest rate on your current mortgage?**

* **17.42%** - Less than 3%
* **48.95%** - 3-4%
* **25.53%** - 4-5%
* **8.11%** - Greater than 5%

"Need to sell" can easily become "would like to sell," and "would like to sell" can easily become "I think I'll wait" for the two thirds of respondents who have sub-4% mortgages.

Of course, buyers face the opposite side of this: mortgage rates that have increased far faster than home prices have decreased.

It is in times like this that knowing your prospective customer matters more than ever. Growth in these conditions is zero-sum: You're either snatching opportunity from your competitors or they are doing the same to you. Being on the right side of this equation requires smarter positioning and marketing, which in turn requires doing your homework. You need an edge.

This report, like our recent report on active buyers, is our effort to give you that edge.

## Topline Findings and Takeaways

A discussion of our results follows below, and different people will find different things of interest in those results, but here are a few topline notes:

### Agent Loyalty Intentions

**75% of respondents indicated that they plan to use the agent that helped them buy their house to sell their house.** This intention decays with tenure of ownership, which one would expect, but we still found this result striking: Most people, early in their process of considering a sale, operate on the assumption that they will use their last agent. Of course, we know that intention does not hold at that rate. The open-ended responses from those who indicated they may use someone else suggest a strong desire to "shop around" or "explore all options."

### Primary Selling Motivation

"Change of lifestyle" was the #1 reason respondents cited for why they are thinking of selling. This suggests that while a change in jobs, death, and divorce will always be strong predictors of transactions, less definite, more aspirational considerations are always present and active.

### Impact of Market Information

Information about price declines accelerating next year make **53% of respondents more likely to sell now**.

### Power of Agent Conversations

About half of respondents reported speaking with an agent about selling recently, and **64% of that group reported that this conversation made them more inclined to sell.** This illuminates the most obvious of opportunities: Engagement with past clients produces significant positive results, even in a market characterized by widespread apprehension.

### Mortgage Rate Concerns

**84% of respondents who have a mortgage on their home are either "very concerned" or "somewhat concerned"** that high mortgage rates will impede their ability to sell. However, when presented with context that explained that refinancing to a lower rate in the future may be possible, **50% said this information made them more inclined to sell**.

### Marketing Material Engagement

**66% of respondents reported reading marketing materials from agents at least occasionally.** When asked to identify which types of agent marketing materials they found most interesting or useful, "those that list recent home sale prices" was respondents' top pick at **39%**. This tried-and-true tactic is likely more relevant to homeowners than ever, as a changing market has people looking around at the market activity in their own neighborhood as a strong signal of their own home's value and the success of their own home sale.

### Home Value Awareness

**91% of respondents report being "very clear" or having "a pretty good idea" of their home's value**, and indicate that an agent's opinion, Zillow, and recent home sales contribute to that understanding. Notably, respondents who had yet to speak with a real estate agent relied much more on Zillow and recent sales to form their opinion of their home's value. This suggests that if real estate agents leave an informational vacuum it will be filled by others.

## Survey Results

<details>

<summary><strong>Q2: Tenure of Ownership — How long have you owned your home?</strong></summary>

* **5.17%** - Less than 2 years
* **28.83%** - 2-5 years
* **39.17%** - 6-10 years
* **18.50%** - 11-20 years
* **8.33%** - 21+ years

Tenure of ownership among our respondents roughly tracked with our expectations. 39% have owned for 6-10 years.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Q3: Agent Reuse Intentions — If you sell, do you plan on using the real estate agent you used to buy your home to sell your home?</strong></summary>

* **75.00%** - Yes
* **25.00%** - No

A large majority plan on using the same agent that helped them buy their home. Research from the NAR and others has shown that eventual outcomes are more or less the inverse: 75% to 80% of people eventually use an agent other than the one they used for their last transaction. This starkly illustrates the loyalty problem 1000watt has inveighed against for years. People want to use their agent again, but are effectively "abandoned" by them. We suspect that now — when people likely have more real estate questions than ever — keeping in touch is even more critical.

Among the 25% who do not plan to use their previous agent for their currently contemplated home sale, most cited a desire to explore alternatives:

> "I want to shop around and see what my selection and options are."

> "I like comparisons."

> "I may consult them \[previous agent], but want to shop around."

> "I may find a better one."

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Q4: Reasons for Selling — Why have you thought about selling your home recently?</strong></summary>

* **25.17%** - Change in lifestyle
* **19.83%** - Want to realize gains in my current home's value
* **19.33%** - Want to move closer to family
* **13.67%** - Job opportunities
* **13.00%** - Looking to downsize
* **3.83%** - Other
* **3.00%** - Death in family
* **2.17%** - Divorce

Respondents cited a range of reasons for considering a sale. Significantly, 13% are downsizing. As discussed above, change of lifestyle was the most-cited driver. Death, divorce, and jobs received fewer responses than expected, suggesting that "softer" considerations that can be influenced or aided by a broker or agent are most important.

<details>

<summary><strong>Q5: Market Perception — What is your general perception of the real estate market right now?</strong></summary>

* **35.33%** - The market is hot, and favors sellers
* **30.83%** - The market is cooling
* **24.50%** - The market is slowed significantly
* **8.33%** - The market has slowed dramatically, and now favors buyers
* **1.00%** - Other

These would-be sellers seem to have internalized the market shift to a fair extent. Only 35% perceive the market as "hot, and favors sellers" while a large majority have lower expectations.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Q6: Top Friction Factors — What is the top factor that has kept you from selling, even though you've thought about it?</strong></summary>

* **34.33%** - The housing market has slowed down and I am not sure I can get the price I want
* **34.17%** - I would have to buy another home and get a mortgage with a much higher interest rate
* **19.67%** - I am worried about the economy generally
* **7.67%** - I am considering renting my home instead of selling it
* **4.17%** - Other

Most respondents have rates and price top of mind. These are areas in which context provided through marketing, advertising, or one-on-one communication can have an impact.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Q7: Agent Conversations — Have you spoken to a real estate agent about selling your home recently?</strong></summary>

* **50.67%** - Yes
* **49.33%** - No

Just over half of respondents have spoken to an agent recently. We take this as an indication that a good number are serious about selling.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Q8: Impact of Agent Conversations — Did speaking with a real estate agent make you more or less inclined to sell your home?</strong></summary>

* **64.47%** - More
* **35.53%** - Less

These conversations seem to lead people closer to transacting, with 64% reporting that talking with an agent made them more inclined to sell.

Representative comments:

> "Because she thoroughly explained the advantages of selling sooner rather than later."

> "They gave me optimism and options for selling my house."

> "He pointed out the true potential of a sale."

> "They gave me a lot of details that made sense to me."

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Q9: "Date the Rate, Marry the House" — Does the following statement make you more or less inclined to sell?</strong></summary>

"Interest rates have risen a lot in the past few months, but if you sell now and then have to get a higher rate for your next mortgage, you can always refinance into a lower rate when they come back down. A new home can be forever, but a new mortgage rate can almost always be changed over time."

* **50.17%** - More inclined
* **29.83%** - It doesn't impact my thinking either way
* **20.00%** - Less inclined

51% of respondents said they were "very concerned" about rising rates, and 34% said they were "somewhat concerned". When presented with context around refinancing in the future, just over 50% indicated this makes them more inclined to sell.

This is an obvious messaging and marketing opportunity.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Q10: Price Decline Information — Does the following statement make you more or less inclined to sell?</strong></summary>

"Most economists project housing prices to decline significantly in 2023, if you sell your home now, you can still command a good price, while likely getting more favorable terms on a new home even a couple months later."

* **52.67%** - More inclined
* **24.33%** - It doesn't impact my thinking either way

"Some real estate home search website/apps make money by sending you to a real estate agent when you click or tap "contact agent" or "schedule a tour" on a home for sale. If you actually buy a home with this agent, the website/app company will take 35% of the commission the agent receives from working with you. This could be as much as $5,000 on the purchase of a $500,000 home. The website/apps do not disclose this payment, which comes out of the money you use to buy the house."

* **37.00%** - I have no problem with it, but it bothers me that they do not disclose this
* **31.67%** - It sounds fair, and I have no problem with it
* **15.67%** - This seems unfair, expensive, and sneaky
* **15.50%** - I am not really comfortable with this
* **0.17%** - Other

When we explain the increasingly common referral fee model, people expressed reservations.

</details>

<details>

## Conclusion

These results show clearly that people who are thinking of selling are hesitant, and concerned about the recent and dramatic changes in the real estate market. But these results show just as clearly that **engagement can have positive effects, both for the prospective seller, and the agent, broker, or marketer who reaches out to them.**

There is a great deal that we in the industry cannot control about the market right now. But we believe that players with a capacity for well-executed marketing are far from powerless to shape outcomes.
