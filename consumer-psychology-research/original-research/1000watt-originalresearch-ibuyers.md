## Introduction

We’ve been talking about iBuying a lot. But we know far too little. We know who’s doing it, where, and roughly at what volume. But there are perhaps more important things that remain quiet unclear, like:

* How big iBuying might get in the future.
* What really motivates homeowners to choose this option over a traditional home sale.
* How those who may find themselves competing with iBuyers in the future can prepare.

Gaining visibility on these things requires that we, as an industry, stop talking only to ourselves about these questions and begin asking homeowners — the prospective iBuyer customer — what they think.

Of course, Zillow, Opendoor, Offerpad and others in this space have conducted exhaustive consumer research in shaping their offerings. That insight is theirs.

What follows is yours.

Use it to understand the customer for whom you are, or will be, competing — and plan accordingly.

## About Our Survey

We fielded a survey to **600 homeowners** across the United States over the age of 25.

Approximately **68% had sold a home before**. **50% of respondents were male; 50% were female**.

**Note:** We refer to the human beings who have, or may, buy or sell real estate as “people” here, not “consumers”. This latter term, while appropriate economic language, tends to numb one to a certain sensitivity required for good marketing.

## Executive Summary

To cut to the chase: **Money isn’t as important as we think it is.**

Most of our homeowner respondents who have sold before found the process **stressful and disruptive** to their lives. When they look forward to a possible future sale, they are driven strongly by avoidance of this experience, and are thus very receptive to the iBuyer proposition.

Those who say things like “iBuying is great for distressed sellers, but won’t grow beyond them,” ignore this reality. Most repeat sellers are **“pre-stressed,”** if not distressed, and are thus quite open to an alternative path. First-time sellers had a ringside seat at the process when they bought.

This isn’t to say that money isn’t important — **62% of respondents said this would be their top goal in a sale** — but rather that a large number of those same people are motivated by stress-avoidance and find the iBuyer proposition attractive when it is presented to them.

Consider this striking response: **77% of respondents said they would be “probably” or “maybe” willing to take 5% -10% less for their home to avoid the hassle of a traditional sale.**

That’s a lot, and it suggests to us that there is still a long way to go before iBuying hits its ceiling.

Those who compete with iBuyers now, or anticipate competing with them in the future, would do well to hone their customer experience and messaging in a way that goes beyond sellers’ financial considerations.

> As we often hear in the industry, home selling is a singularly personal and emotional transaction. Our results suggest this holds true as homeowners consider, with increasing frequency, this new way of selling. We should heed our own axiom here.

## Results and Analysis

The seedbed for most new ideas is either discomfort, fear, or aspiration. So it is with iBuying. The stress and uncertainty expressed by our respondents who had sold before is striking.

**More than 70% of these sellers found the process either “stressful” or “very stressful.”**

As you will see below, and as years of research from the National Association of Realtors shows, a large majority of people are pleased with their agent after the transaction. This suggests that the stress expressed in our results has little to do with antipathy for, or avoidance of, real estate agents.

**It’s the process (the game), not the agent (the player) that is stressing people out.**

| Q1. Was selling your home stressful? | Answer (%) |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Yes, very stressful                  | 34.07%     |
| Yes, stressful                       | 36.30%     |
| Yes, a little stressful              | 24.69%     |
| Not stressful                        | 4.94%      |

### Sources of Seller Stress

The sources of seller stress are straightforward and powerful — violation of one’s most personal space, and disruption of one’s life for a significant period of time cannot be not remedied with an app, or waved away as “part of the deal.”

These are problems hungry for a solution that iBuying provides.

| Q2. What was the biggest reason you found selling your home to be stressful? | Answer (%) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Having strangers in my home for showings/open houses                         | 43.90%     |
| It took too long                                                             | 27.01%     |
| Having to move out during the process                                        | 24.42%     |
| Other                                                                        | 4.68%      |

The “other” responses underscore the deeply uncertain nature of the traditional selling path. Here’s a sampling:

* “The not knowing.”
* “Dealing with the buyers.”
* “Having the home off the market while it was in contingency.”
* “Not sure if the price is set correctly.”

iBuying neutralizes these concerns immediately by offering a fast, linear, certain, effectively non-contingent proposition.

### “Your money or your life” - What matters most?

We began with the most straightforward question: “What matters most?”

**62% responded, “the money!”**

This could lead one to assume that the iBuyer proposition, at least for now, is relatively weak with most potential sellers.

We interpret this differently. **40% of people place speed and certainty above price** — before we place a generic iBuyer pitch in front of them later in the survey. Moreover, our expectation was that many more people would put money at the top of their priority list. Of course almost every seller wants top dollar above all else. It’s a no-brainer, rationally.

Turns out it’s not for a significant number of potential sellers.

| Q3. If you were to sell your current home today, what would be most important to you? | Answer (%) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Getting the absolute highest price possible                                           | 62.17%     |
| Having a simple, certain, process                                                     | 22.00%     |
| Getting the transaction completed quickly                                             | 15.83%     |

### Reaction to the iBuyer Pitch

The story gets even more interesting when we ask people to react to this generic iBuyer pitch:

> “We will buy your home, for a fair price, in cash. You will receive the money, and close the transaction, in a matter of a few days. We will charge you fees that are similar to selling with a real estate agent, but you will avoid all the hassles of showings, open houses, and be able to move on with your life.”

The responses are overwhelmingly positive:

| Q4. If you were selling your home, and a credible company made you this offer, how would you react? | Answer (%) |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Somewhat positively                                                                                 | 51.00%     |
| Very positively                                                                                     | 30.67%     |
| Somewhat negatively                                                                                 | 15.67%     |
| Very negatively                                                                                     | 2.67%      |

> One might say that this pitch is like offering candy to a baby. Of course homeowners respond positively to a hypothetical offer that seems to have no downside.

But bear in mind that this pitch is presented in various forms to millions of people every day. People who are becoming more aware of this new path; people who will begin to know more and more people who take it; people who, when their time to sell comes, will have an abundance of information with which to consider this offer in a very real way.

### Why the Positive Reaction?

When we ask people why they find this offer attractive, the answers are predictable, certainly, but tie strongly to the felt stress of their previous transaction experiences.

**Avoiding hassle and uncertainty is what it’s all about.** What it’s not about, really, is aversion to working with agents. Again, the game is viewed as the problem, not the agent/player.

| Q5. What is the biggest reason why you would react positively?                           | Answer (%) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| The certainty of a cash offer as opposed to a buyer with financing that may fall through | 50.00%     |
| Avoiding the time and hassle of selling with an agent                                    | 41.43%     |
| I would like to avoid working with a real estate agent                                   | 7.35%      |
| Other                                                                                    | 1.22%      |

When we ask the \~19% of respondents who reacted to our pitch negatively why they did so, the top answer, by far, is **“I think there must be a catch.”** This seems about right to us for something so new and, on the surface, perhaps too good to be true.

It is the job of the iBuyer to overcome this perception. To date this has been done with social proof, data, comparisons to traditional selling and, in the case of Zillow, brand equity. We think these things will become more powerful over time.

### Why the Negative Reaction?

\~20% of respondents identify the potential downside of iBuying — forfeiting a true market price. It remains to be seen how the delta between market versus iBuyer prices evolves over time, but the trend seems to be toward parity, and both Zillow and Opendoor have signalled that the home transaction itself may come to be viewed as a loss leader for a larger home services business.

| Q6. What is the biggest reason why you would react negatively?             | Answer (%) |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| I think there must be a catch                                              | 55.45%     |
| I think I could get more using a real estate agent                         | 20.91%     |
| I want to work closely with a person who will guide me through the process | 17.27%     |
| Other                                                                      | 6.36%      |

Having considered the iBuyer proposition, with its promise of removing the stress and uncertainty people dread, people seem to prioritize their life over their money.

**77% of all respondents would be willing to give up 5% - 10% on their sale price in exchange for convenience and certainty.**

| Q7. Would you be willing to make 5% to 10% less on the sale of your home for the convenience and certainty of an instant, cash offer? | Answer (%) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Maybe                                                                                                                                 | 50.00%     |
| Yes, probably                                                                                                                         | 27.17%     |
| No, I would not                                                                                                                       | 22.83%     |

This suggest several things:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### iBuying is a solution to a real problem

The responses show a strong desire to avoid the hassles and uncertainties of traditional selling.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Emotion trumps financial calculation

Many respondents prioritize speed, certainty, and reduced stress above maximizing sale price.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### The ceiling for iBuyer market share is potentially quite high

Willingness to accept a price reduction for convenience suggests large potential adoption.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Consider, too, that this survey was fielded in a historic seller’s market, when homes are selling very quickly. We suspect that while the economics may get harder for iBuyers if we move to a more balanced market, the pitch will get easier.

When sellers have to face longer days on market, and more negotiating with buyers, the pull of a simpler alternative will likely become stronger.

## The Branded iBuyer: Zillow

Opendoor pioneered iBuying; Zillow is a household name that has bet its franchise on iBuying (Zillow Offers). From our perspective, Zillow is the more interesting company to watch.

First, it will be Zillow that will educate Americans about iBuying at scale. With an audience of more than 200 million each month, and an increasing integration of Zillow Offers into the user experience, it will be Zillow that takes iBuying to a mass market.

Second, Zillow Offers is supported by tremendous brand equity.

> Industry grievances do not diminish this undeniable reality: people trust the Zillow brand.

If iBuying cannot scale with the most known and trusted national real estate brand ever behind it, it cannot scale.

Consider these predictable, but nonetheless remarkable, responses from our homeowners:

* **94% had aided awareness of Zillow** (this for a 15 year-old company!)
* When asked, “On a scale of 1-10, 1 being “least favorable” and 10 being “most favorable,” how would you rate your impression of Zillow?” **67% rated Zillow 8 or higher.**

### Zillow Trust vs. Real Estate Agents

When we asked people about Zillow’s trustworthiness relative to real estate agents, only **18% said they would trust Zillow less than an agent.**

| Q8. Are you more or less likely to trust information from Zillow than information from a real estate agent? | Answer (%) |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Trust them about the same                                                                                   | 54.59%     |
| More likely to trust Zillow than a real estate agent                                                        | 27.21%     |
| Less likely to trust Zillow than a real estate agent                                                        | 18.20%     |

When we asked those more inclined to trust Zillow over agents why they held this view, the feeling seems less driven by a negative view of agents, than a positive experience with Zillow.

**People use Zillow, like Zillow, and trust Zillow.** This is the foundation upon which millions of people will be presented the iBuying opportunity in the coming years.

| Q9. Why are you more likely to trust information from Zillow? | Answer (%) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| I use Zillow and like it                                      | 64.29%     |
| I generally don’t trust real estate agents                    | 20.13%     |
| Zillow is an unbiased source                                  | 15.58%     |
| Other                                                         | 0.00%      |

## Conclusions and Possible Responses

Today, iBuying is unevenly distributed and accounts for a very small percentage of total home sales.

What this survey tells us, however, is that the rails on which iBuyers will run into the future are like greased lightning. People are **emotionally primed for the proposition**. They will sacrifice a lot to avoid privacy invasion and life disruption.

> The expansion of iBuying is therefore largely dependent upon solving problems other than selling people on the idea.

Better data models will be needed to bring iBuying beyond markets characterized by relatively homogeneous mid-market housing stock. Operational excellence will be paramount if iBuyers are to continue to grow beyond today’s hyper-appreciating market.

We think it would be unwise to assume that these things won’t happen.

We suggest, then, that those who anticipate competing with iBuyers more often in the future begin crafting their counter propositions now.

This means messaging that speaks to the underlying drivers of iBuying: **sellers’ aversion to uncertainty, hassle, and violation of privacy.**

What is your response? How can you address those concerns meaningfully? What needs to change in your customer experience so that those things that cause stress can be mitigated?

We think any strong response must go beyond the financial or “dueling net sheet” argument. As the results above show, plenty of people are willing to give up a market price if they can gain speed and certainty. And the market versus iBuyer price gap is likely to continue shrinking in any event.

We expect the traditional selling path to remain viable for years to come. But we also expect its dominance to diminish as people become more familiar with this new way.

Those that wish to participate in this future should begin planning for it in the present.
