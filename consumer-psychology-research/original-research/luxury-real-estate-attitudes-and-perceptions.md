# luxury real estate attitudes and perceptions

**Date:** 10.2021

## Introduction

"Luxury." The inscrutable queen of real estate buzzwords.

What do we mean when we speak of luxury real estate? What makes a luxury brand? Are the tropes our industry consistently employs to communicate the idea of luxury even effective in 2021?

Most real estate brands have a luxury division, and many agents claim to be luxury agents. But how are buyers and sellers receiving this? These are big questions we want to begin exploring. This survey research is a start.

Our questions produced some illuminating insights. Simply labeling something "luxury" still seems to be a **potent way to entice affluent people** and help them make decisions. For example, while "Coldwell Banker Global Luxury" or "Luxury Portfolio International" may strike some as a little too on the nose, they are likely smart choices.

However, we did uncover some **incongruity** between what the real estate industry thinks of as a luxury image or brand, and the perceptions of people outside of it. When presented with images of 4 well-known real estate logos — 3 of which are considered high-end brands inside the industry — **Keller Williams was the most identified with luxury**, narrowly edging out Sotheby’s.

We also asked people some of the same questions we asked of Millennial renters in our earlier research study on young would-be homebuyers, and found some interesting divergences. It is also clear that perceptions of luxury are **strongly gendered**.

We think you’ll find these findings helpful in defining what luxury means within your own organization.

## About Our Survey

We fielded a survey of 600 people over the age of 25, across the United States, with an individual income of over $150,000.

| Demographic                                    | Percentage |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Male Respondents                               | 56%        |
| Female Respondents                             | 44%        |
| Completed University or Postgraduate Education | 91%        |

## Results and Analysis

### Image: Signs and Appeal

We began by asking which of two signs from a well-known brand respondents found more appealing: Redfin’s “regular” sign (A) versus Redfin’s luxury program sign (B).

| Preference              | Overall (%) | Male (%) | Female (%) |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Sign A (Regular)        | 52%         | 60%      | 42%        |
| Sign B (Luxury Program) | 48%         | 40%      | 58%        |

In another comparison of two different signs (A and B):

| Preference | Overall (%) | Male (%) | Female (%) |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Sign A     | 58%         | 50%      | 68%        |
| Sign B     | 42%         | 50%      | 32%        |

It seems that a luxury “look” is more subjective than we may assume, or may not itself carry tremendous weight.

### Agent Image and Affiliation

When it comes to an agent’s image, things are less nuanced — it matters (at least the car!).

**Q1. Your Realtor arrives for your first meeting in a Hyundai. Does this give you pause?**

| Answer            | Answer (%) |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Yes, very much so | 44.83%     |
| Yes, a little     | 18.67%     |
| No, not really    | 20.00%     |
| No, not at all    | 16.50%     |

**Gendered Perception:** 59% of males answered “yes, very much so,” while the top response by females was “no, not really,” at 30%.

An agent’s brand affiliation seems to matter a lot to affluent people:

**Q2. In hiring a real estate agent, how important is/would be the brand an agent is affiliated with?**

| Answer               | Answer (%) |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| Very important       | 48.00%     |
| Somewhat important   | 41.83%     |
| Not important at all | 10.17%     |

### The Luxury Label

We asked people if they responded well to products or services that were explicitly labeled “luxury.”

**Q3. When a product or service claims to be, or has in its name, “luxury,” what is your initial reaction?**

| Answer   | Answer (%) |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Positive | 71.33%     |
| Neutral  | 22.33%     |
| Negative | 6.33%      |

This suggests that affixing the term "luxury" to a brand, program, or property can be effective.

Respondents were then asked to select which attributes make a home or property considered “luxury.”

**Q4. What attributes make a home or property considered “luxury real estate”?**

| Answer                | Answer (%) |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| Features and finishes | 40.68%     |
| Price                 | 32.90%     |
| Location              | 26.42%     |

### What is a Luxury Brand?

For years, a luxury brand in real estate was almost certain to have one or both of these visual attributes: the color black and a script font. We asked if people still see certain brands as luxury.

**Q5. Generally speaking, do you see these brands as luxury brands?**

| Answer | Answer (%) |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Yes    | 79.83%     |
| No     | 20.17%     |

The response was a resounding **yes**. Clearly, brands can create “luxury” associations without anchoring their visual identity in traditionally upscale or high-end patterns.

We next provided respondents with the choice of four real estate brands and asked them to identify the two they most felt were the luxury brands.

**Q6. Which 2 of these real estate brands do you most see as “luxury” brands?**

| Brand           | Answer (%) |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Keller Williams | 26.17%     |
| Sotheby’s       | 25.17%     |
| Compass         | 24.50%     |
| Coldwell Banker | 24.17%     |

**Key Finding:** **Keller Williams**, a brand not positioned in luxury territory in the industry, was the most chosen option. This suggests that peoples’ notion of what a luxury real estate brand is is broader, and perhaps different, than that of industry professionals.

### The Luxury Listing

We asked people to choose from 3 hypothetical listing strategies.

**Q7. If you were selling a home, and a real estate agent told you about three ways to promote your home to people who might buy it, which of these would you choose?**

| Listing Strategy                                                                               | Answer (%) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Put on company website, Zillow, and **MLS** (every agent will see it)                          | 49.17%     |
| Put on company website, promote to office, presented as **"exclusive"** or "private exclusive" | 43.50%     |
| Put on company website and also place it on **Zillow**                                         | 7.33%      |

Option three, which included placing the listing on the **MLS**, was the leading response. Notably, the **“exclusive listing”** option was only a few points behind, showing the draw of positioning one’s home as something rare.

Nearly 75% of respondents indicated that if they were selling their home, it would be **very important or somewhat important** that their agent marketed their home as a “luxury property.”

**Q8. If you were selling your home now, how important would it be that your real estate agent marketed your home publicly as a “luxury” property?**

| Answer               | Answer (%) |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| Very important       | 53.33%     |
| Somewhat important   | 21.50%     |
| Not very important   | 17.00%     |
| Not important at all | 8.17%      |

Also, a clear majority of respondents indicated that real estate is an important part of their financial plan.

**Q9. Is investing in real estate an important part of your financial plan?**

| Answer     | Answer (%) |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Definitely | 52.33%     |
| Somewhat   | 31.17%     |
| No         | 12.00%     |
| Unsure     | 4.50%      |

### Affluent Respondents vs. Millennial Renters

We compared the responses of the high-income respondents to a previous study on Millennial renters.

**Q10. Roughly how often do you look at homes online?**

| Answer                     | Affluent Respondents (%) | Millennial Renters (%) |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Every day                  | 35.33%                   | 15%                    |
| A couple of times per week | 46.17%                   | 45%                    |
| Rarely                     | 15.83%                   | -                      |
| Never                      | 2.67%                    | -                      |

**Key Finding:** High-income respondents are **even more engaged** with looking at homes online, with 35% looking daily compared to 15% of Millennial renters.

**Q11. Would you ever consider buying a home without physically touring it, using photos/videos/3-D tours instead?**

| Answer                                      | Affluent Respondents (%) | Millennial Renters (%)     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Yes, I would                                | 46.50%                   | 31% (Definitely would)     |
| Maybe, if a physical tour were not possible | 19.50%                   | -                          |
| Probably not                                | 18.67%                   | -                          |
| No, definitely not                          | 15.33%                   | 18% (Definitely would not) |

**Key Finding:** High-income respondents were **more confident** in buying a home sight-unseen, with 46% saying they would, compared to 31% of Millennial renters.

#### Impact of Climate Change

**Q12. Is climate change impacting how you think about homeownership?**

| Answer         | Affluent Respondents (%) | Millennial Respondents (%) |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Yes, a lot     | 43.17%                   | \~25% (Nearly a quarter)   |
| Yes, somewhat  | 28.33%                   | -                          |
| No, not really | 16.50%                   | -                          |
| No, not at all | 12.00%                   | -                          |

**Total Impact:** Nearly **72%** of luxury respondents said climate change is having an impact, compared to 52% of Millennial respondents.

**Q13. Does climate change make buying a home more or less attractive to you?**

| Answer                    | Affluent Respondents (%) | Millennial Renters (%) |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| A lot more attractive     | 26.33%                   | -                      |
| Somewhat more attractive  | 32.50%                   | -                      |

| A lot less attractive     | 11.33%                   | -                      |
| **Total Less Attractive** | **41.16%**               | **41%**                |

**Key Finding:** High-income respondents were **more optimistic**, with nearly 59% saying climate change is making buying a home **more attractive**.

#### Impact of the Pandemic

**Q14. Has the pandemic changed how you think about homeownership?**

| Answer         | Affluent Respondents (%) | Millennial Renters (%) |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |

| No, not at all | 11.17%                   | -                      |

**Total Yes:** Over **72%** of luxury respondents said yes, compared to 63% of Millennial renters.

**Q15. Has the pandemic made buying a home more or less attractive to you?**

| Answer                    | Affluent Respondents (%) | Millennial Renters (%) |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| A lot more attractive     | 34.00%                   | -                      |

**Key Finding:** Nearly **66%** of luxury respondents say that the pandemic has made a home purchase **more attractive**, while 55% of Millennials agree.

### Impression of Real Estate Agents

**Q16. What is your general impression of real estate agents?**

| Answer      | Affluent Respondents (%) | Millennial Renters (%) |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Favorable   | 64.00%                   | 33%                    |
| Neutral     | 31.00%                   | 57%                    |
| Unfavorable | 5.00%                    | 10%                    |

**Key Finding:** The majority of affluent respondents had a **favorable impression** (64%), while Millennial renters were less positive (33% favorable).

**Q17. Why is your impression of real estate agents unfavorable?**

| Answer                                          | Answer (%) |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Many seem sleazy/salesy                         | 43.75%     |
| I think they charge too much for their services | 43.75%     |
| I don’t think they understand people my age     | 8.33%      |
| I don’t think they understand technology        | 4.17%      |

On this question, the responses were nearly identical across both groups.

The most common response from both the luxury respondents and the Millennial renters said their unfavorable impression of realtors had to do with the **commission rate and transparency of costs**.

**Q18. Do you know how real estate agents are paid?**

| Answer     | Affluent Respondents (%) | Millennial Renters (%) |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Yes        | 68.00%                   | 64%                    |
| Kind of    | 27.33%                   | -                      |
| Not at all | 4.67%                    | -                      |

## Conclusions and Possibilities

A fancy logo does not make a luxury brand. We knew that. You knew that. But these results give us a clear reminder of this obvious truth.

But labeling something as **“luxury”** or **“exclusive”** or **“premier,”** however heavy-handed that may seem, does seem to land with people.

The image of luxury is shifting. This presents opportunities for companies interested in exploring new territories.

Our high-earning respondents are very engaged with the world of real estate. Both the pandemic and climate change seem to have moved real estate more forward in peoples’ consciousness. Moving with them as they think about real estate and homeownership in new and different ways is a good idea.
