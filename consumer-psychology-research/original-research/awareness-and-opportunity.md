## Marketing, Awareness, and Opportunity

### Introduction

Consensus estimates for total existing home sales this year are in the **4.2 - 4.4 million range**. Meanwhile, NAR membership just crested **1.5 million**. The conclusion is obvious: brokers, teams, and agents who want to win in 2023 are going to need to up their game. There will be many hungry practitioners hunting down deals and a lot of marketing and advertising noise directed toward potential buyers and sellers.

Our baseline guidance to clients has always been simple:

* Keep your clients close to realize the “compounding interest” of loyalty.
* Always be differentiating.

These principles have never been more important. In this survey, we asked people a range of questions aimed at identifying areas of opportunity and vulnerability in today’s market: Where are people’s heads at right now? What is their exposure to real estate marketing? What is their awareness of options for their next transaction?

We break down the responses and highlight interesting notes below.

## Detailed Results

### Post-Close Contact with Agent

| Answer                                  | Answer (%) |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Yes, my agent contacted/contacts me     | 46.67%     |
| Yes, I contacted/contact my agent       | 32.00%     |
| No, I have had no contact with my agent | 21.33%     |

As a marketing baseline, we asked these recent buyers about their post-close contact with their agent. While less than half of respondents have heard from their agent, nearly a third had reached out, which suggests a propensity based on perceived value. The implication here is obvious and strong: keep in touch.

### Agent Communication Methods

| Answer                          | Answer (%) |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- |
| My agent calls me               | 67.86%     |
| My agent texts me               | 51.07%     |
| My agent emails me              | 49.64%     |
| My agent drops by my house      | 14.64%     |
| My agent DMs me on social media | 11.97%     |
| Other                           | 1.07%      |

Of those that did hear from their agent, the means of communication seem varied but weighted toward phone, text, and email.

### Buyer Satisfaction

| Answer                           | Answer (%) |
| -------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Yes, very much so                | 62.00%     |
| Yes, all things considered       | 29.67%     |
| No, I have some regrets          | 6.67%      |
| No, buying my home was a mistake | 1.67%      |

Despite media reports to the contrary, most of our recent buyers are glad they bought a home during the pandemic boom period.

### Loyalty Intention for Next Sale

| Answer          | Answer (%) |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Yes, definitely | 41.17%     |
| Yes, probably   | 35.67%     |
| Maybe           | 13.50%     |
| No, I would not | 9.67%      |

When we asked those who responded “maybe” or “No, I would not” to explain themselves, the most common open-ended responses were:

* I was not happy with the performance of my agent.
* I do not intend to use an agent for my next transaction.
* I am now aware of an agent I like better.

Numbers 2 and 3 are the most actionable with proactive post-close contact/marketing.

### Biggest Challenge Owning a Home

| Answer                                | Answer (%) |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Ongoing maintenance costs             | 42.83%     |
| Affording my monthly mortgage payment | 34.17%     |
| Stress about my home’s value          | 20.33%     |
| Other                                 | 2.67%      |

Somewhat surprisingly, only 20% of respondents expressed anxiety over their home’s value. Rather, ongoing maintenance costs were cited as the top challenge. Those who go beyond facile “it’s time to clean your gutters” templates are likely to tap into stronger engagement.

### Consideration of "Discount" Real Estate Services

| Answer             | Answer (%) |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Yes, maybe         | 48.67%     |
| Yes, definitely    | 31.00%     |
| No, probably not   | 12.00%     |
| No, definitely not | 8.33%      |

Recent buyers responded strongly and positively to the possibility of using a “discount” real estate service for their next transaction. As market realities tell us, only a small number ultimately choose this direction, but the result underscores the need to sell value consistently.

### Agent Compensation in a Hypothetical Scenario

Scenario: You list your house for sale for $500,000. Your real estate agent helps prepare your home, hosts some open houses, places your home on Zillow and the local MLS, and handles the paperwork. Your home sells for the price you want. This takes a total of 40 hours and their commission is $12,500 — or $312.50 per hour.

| Answer          | Answer (%) |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| No, not really  | 44.89%     |
| No, not at all  | 27.56%     |
| Yes, probably   | 22.67%     |
| Yes, definitely | 4.89%      |

When presented with a concrete example of what an agent does and how much they earn, people have very little problem with the amount of compensation. Explaining what an agent does and how they do it can lead to positive outcomes.

### Exposure to Real Estate Marketing

| Answer           | Answer (%) |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Yes, some        | 46.67%     |
| Yes, a lot of it | 27.83%     |
| No, not much     | 15.50%     |
| No, not at all   | 10.00%     |

Respondents are exposed to advertising or marketing from competitors — 28% reported getting “a lot” of it. Social, direct mail, email, bus benches — people are consistently exposed to messages that aim to disrupt your relationship.

### Usefulness of Marketing

| Answer         | Answer (%) |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| Yes, some      | 62.78%     |
| No, not really | 32.59%     |
| No, never      | 4.63%      |

Well over half of respondents view at least some of this marketing as useful or attention-worthy. The challenge and opportunity is to be the best at activating and guiding this interest.

### Unaided Agent Recall

| Answer          | Answer (%) |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Yes, one or two | 47.22%     |
| Yes, several    | 21.85%     |
| No, not really  | 24.26%     |
| No, not at all  | 6.67%      |

Only about a third of respondents can’t recall the name of an agent or broker from whom they receive marketing, indicating that marketing efforts do produce unaided recall for many.

## Advertising Piece Test

We tested a print marketing piece from Matt Winzenreid (Matt Winzenreid Real Estate Partners, Madison, WI). We asked respondents two questions about the ad.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Response to the “#1 in Westside sales” claim

The “#1” claim was received quite favorably, with the large majority selecting five or above on a 0–10 scale. “#1” implies success, experience, trustworthiness, and performance.

Gender difference: Women responded somewhat differently, selecting fewer 8–10 ratings and clustering around 6 more often than men.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Response to the “Free Home Valuation” offer

Respondents were generally favorable but responses were mixed across the scale.

Reasons for unfavorable responses included concerns about generic presentation, pressure to follow up, lack of trustworthiness, already knowing their home value, lack of clarity about the offer, and missing evidence to substantiate the claim.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

<details>

<summary>Reasons for unfavorable response (verbatim themes)</summary>

* Looks generic and cookie cutter.
* I would feel obligated to follow up with this person even if I didn’t want the service offered.
* Not trustworthy enough.
* I already have a good idea of what my home is worth. Also, I don’t want to be pressured by the realtor into doing anything.
* The ad just doesn’t have the “trust me” component to it.
* It’s just a picture of a bunch of pals, with the company they work for. I need more than a chum to show me a house.
* Too busy, the point doesn’t come across clearly.
* There’s no evidence or clarification of what the offer means.

</details>

These responses provide useful insights about the need for specificity, clarity, and objection handling in advertising.
