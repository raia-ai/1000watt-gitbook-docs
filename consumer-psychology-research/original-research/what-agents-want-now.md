# what agents want now

**Original Research: October 2025**

## Introduction

Our survey of 600 agents reveals an industry caught between pressure and possibility. In a market strained by economic headwinds and clouded by headlines, agents remain the steady hand moving deals forward.

Economic forces collided. Lawsuits landed. A major acquisition is set to reshape the map. What we're living through now are the aftershocks.

Agents want leadership with vision sharp enough to cut through noise. Technology that powers growth. Training that builds careers. A brand that signals strength and delivers proof daily.

Too often, those pieces are scattered, muted, or missing entirely.

Consumers buy confidence. They buy empathy. They buy trust. The brokerages arming agents with these things are the ones that win.

This is the inflection point. Organizations that forge vision, technology, culture, and proof into a story sharper than market noise will rise. Those that fail risk losing ground.

The moment is now.

### Mobility is Steady, but the Next Generation is Restless

#### The Takeaway

When asked if they are more open to switching brokerages than a year ago, half feel about the same, while **31% are more open**, and **20% are less open**. This stability holds across roles and brokerage models.

The exception is age: **53% of agents under 35** say they are more open to moving—nearly four times the rate of those 55+ (13%) and well above the 38% of those 35–54.

> The 53% mobility openness among younger agents reveals a critical talent retention vulnerability despite stable overall churn. This generational divide suggests the value of loyalty architecture aligned to career-stage motivations. The opportunity lies in moving beyond universal value propositions toward precision loyalty engineering, where brokerages craft experience continuums that transform restless momentum-seekers into anchored veteran producers through intentional progression frameworks. Competitive advantage awaits those who master this evolutionary loyalty equation.

#### Consider

* **Make under-35 loyalty a strategy:** Invest in high value growth-supporting initiatives to convert ‘openness to leave’ into reasons to stay.
* **Keep seasoned agents engaged through community:** Reinforce loyalty by recognizing experience and fostering connection.
* **Build a career-stage loyalty plan:** Create a framework that evolves with tenure and align incentives and support to each stage.

| Openness to Change | Percentage |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| About the same     | 50%        |
| More open          | 30%        |
| Less open          | 20%        |
{% endstep %}

### Clear Brokerage Vision Nearly Doubles Agent Happiness

#### The Takeaway

Most agents are positive about their brokerage: **82% happy**, 13% neutral, 5% unhappy. With clear vision, satisfaction rises even more.

Among the **87% who say their brokerage has a clear vision**, **87% are happy**, 11% are neutral, and just 2% are unhappy. That’s nearly double the happiness rate compared with agents who don’t see vision (13%). In that group, less than half (46%) are happy, while 29% are neutral and 26% are unhappy.

Agents told us vision matters when it’s communicated and carried out. When leaders back direction with action and let it guide decisions, agents feel aligned and confident.

> Vision clarity creates a dramatic happiness differential between brokerages with and without clear direction. This is more than articulation; it's about operational embodiment. Strategic brokerages are evolving beyond aspirational statements toward integrated vision architecture, where direction manifests in compensation structures, resource allocation, and everyday decisions. Without operational integration, even the most elegant vision remains just words on a wall, a map nobody follows.

#### Consider

* **Build vision into daily practice:** Build it into onboarding, recognition, and team meetings that show progress against a clearly communicated direction.
* **Make vision a recruiting asset:** Promote your future (growth, innovation, culture) as a magnet for talent.
* **Translate proof into content:** Share updates (new offices, product launches, training wins) that show vision in action and give agents stories worth telling.

| Brokerage has a clear vision | Percentage |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| Yes                          | 87%        |
| No                           | 13%        |
{% endstep %}

### Technology Drives Affiliation, Nudges Moves

#### The Takeaway

Technology is table stakes, a near-universal factor when agents choose which brokerage to affiliate with. **Four out of five (80%) say it is important or most important** when evaluating a brokerage.

* Younger agents tilt higher, with **78% under 35** saying tech matters most, compared with 63% of older peers.
* The pattern holds across gender, with **85% of women** and 77% of men pointing to technology as a driver.
* Virtual and traditional models are aligned too, with 84% and 80% respectively saying it’s a priority.

When it comes to switching brokerages, however, technology carries less weight. **Only one in five agents (20%) name it as their primary reason to move.** The impact is sharper among agents at virtual brokerages (34%) compared with traditional brokerages (17%).

> Technology strongly influences which brokerage agents join but seldom serves as their main reason to exit. Nevertheless, it remains an important factor, especially for younger and virtual agents who depend on strong systems. Forward-thinking brokerages position their digital ecosystem not as mere tools but as performance multipliers that enhance transaction quality, streamline client experiences, and build agent confidence.

#### Consider

* **Showcase proof through people:** Spotlight younger and virtual agents who are winning with your systems to reinforce relevance and credibility.
* **Transform tech into success narratives:** Highlight measurable wins like accelerated transactions, secured listings, and deepened client connections.
* **Make clients the validators:** Showcase consumer praise for tech-enhanced experiences. Agents value their tech more when clients acknowledge the difference.
* **Map tech to moments that matter:** Highlight how tech supports the highest-stress points of a deal (pricing, showings, negotiations, closing) so agents see it as deal-critical.

| Importance of Technology for Affiliation | Percentage |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| It’s the most important consideration    | 29%        |
| Very important                           | 52%        |
| Somewhat important                       | 16%        |
| Not very important                       | 2%         |
| Not important at all                     | 1%         |

### Compensation Wins Attention, Culture Holds Loyalty

#### The Takeaway

Compensation sparks interest but doesn't hold agents. Brokerages offering multiple comp models (53%) see agents **18 percentage points more likely to consider switching** (39% vs. 21%). Similarly, those with recruiting-linked revenue share programs (50%) see mobility openness nearly double (41% vs. 21%).

When asked for the single biggest reason they’ve stayed with their brokerage, **only 13% pointed to compensation**. Culture, leadership, loyalty, and personal relationships (together **43%**) are still—by far—the top reasons agents stay.

Income creates a distinct mobility pattern: agents at both extremes, **lowest earners (42% under $50K)** and **highest earners (41% over $100K)**, show greater openness to switching than mid-range producers (34% at $50-99K).

> Compensation captures attention but culture secures loyalty. This creates a clear strategic contrast: firms competing primarily on commission structures enter unsustainable escalation cycles, while those investing in belonging create defensive moats their competitors struggle to breach. Comp may turn heads, but community keeps agents rooted.

#### Consider

* **Market comp as career design, not math:** Show how your structure creates long-term income stability, not just a bigger check this month.
* **Show ROI, not perks:** Recast incentives (marketing budgets, training stipends, equity shares) as investments that return measurable business outcomes.
* **Reframe comp around belonging:** When agents feel invested in the business (profit share, equity, brand-building), money becomes connection, not just payout.

| Top Reasons Agents Stay with Current Brokerage | Percentage (Approximate from Chart) |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Culture and leadership                         | \~18%                               |
| Loyalty/personal relationships                 | \~15%                               |
| Favorable split or fees (Compensation)         | \~13%                               |
| Brand reputation                               | \~12%                               |
| Recruiting incentives/residuals                | \~10%                               |
| The hassle of moving                           | \~7%                                |
| Marketing support                              | \~5%                                |
| Technology                                     | \~4%                                |
| Other                                          | \~16%                               |

### Cold Recruiting Outreach Isn’t Cold if It’s Credible

#### The Takeaway

Nearly **four in ten agents (39%) say they never respond** to cold recruiter outreach. Among those who do, the triggers are clear:

* **76%** would respond to better compensation
* **57%** to more leads
* **55%** to a clearer vision
* **24%** to stronger training and support

The flip side is just as sharp. Red flags in a recruiting pitch are unmistakable: **51% flagged automation**, **47% pushiness**, and **40% overpromising**.

> Recruitment communication serves as a preview of the brokerage experience—what agents encounter during outreach shapes what they expect from the relationship. Value-focused personalization opens doors while automation and hype firmly close them. This creates a strategic imperative: treat recruitment not as separate from your value proposition but as its first tangible demonstration. The quality of your outreach establishes the foundation and expectations for the entire potential partnership.

#### Consider

* **Stage experiences that double as proof:** Move beyond events-as-pitches. Host masterminds, market labs, or client-experience simulations where agents see the systems and culture in action rather than being told about them.
* **Design milestone-specific value:** Demonstrate precisely how your brokerage addresses evolving agent needs at key career inflection points.

| What Would Make Agents Respond to Cold Outreach? | Percentage (Approximate from Chart) |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| A credible offer of better compensation          | 25%                                 |
| A clearly articulated company vision             | 19%                                 |
| Promise of more leads                            | 19%                                 |
| Never respond to cold recruiter outreach         | 21%                                 |
| A pitch about better training/support            | 8%                                  |
| Other                                            | 8%                                  |
{% endstep %}

### Training is a Loyalty Lever, Especially in Teams

#### The Takeaway

Training is one of the strongest drivers of brokerage affiliation: **seven out of ten agents (70%) say it is important or very important** when deciding where to affiliate.

Value rises inside teams—**81% of team members** and **72% of team leads** cite training as critical—compared with 63% of solo agents.

Agents told us training builds confidence, accelerates growth, and compounds productivity. It creates an environment agents grow into rather than outgrow.

> Training functions as a pivotal retention lever with amplified impact within team structures. Forward-thinking brokerages recognize development not as a cost center but as a strategic investment generating compound returns in both productivity and loyalty. In an evolving marketplace, robust training creates environments agents grow into rather than outgrow, transforming potential exit points into long-term career anchors.

#### Consider

* **Measure training ROI:** Track the revenue and retention generated by agents who complete your programs to prove the investment.
* **Make training a team asset:** Design training to support team leads, enabling them to coach and develop their members.
* **Build a training continuum:** Offer a clear path from novice to expert, making development a core part of the career architecture.

| Importance of Training for Affiliation                | Percentage (Approximate from Chart) |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Very important —it’s the most important consideration | 26%                                 |
| Very important                                        | 44%                                 |
| Important                                             | 20%                                 |
| Not very important                                    | 7%                                  |
| Not important at all                                  | 3%                                  |
{% endstep %}

### Recruiting Momentum Belongs to Brands with Proof

#### The Takeaway

The most effective recruiting tool is a **strong, credible brand**.

* **45%** of agents say a brokerage’s **brand reputation** is one of the top three factors they consider when moving.
* **39%** say **leadership** is a top three factor.
* **36%** say **culture** is a top three factor.

The factors that agents say matter most when evaluating a brokerage are the ones that are hardest to fake: brand, leadership, and culture. These are the elements that create a sense of belonging and stability.

> In a market defined by noise and uncertainty, agents are looking for proof, not just promises. The most successful recruiting is a byproduct of operational excellence—when a brokerage’s vision, technology, and culture are all aligned and producing measurable success, the brand itself becomes the most powerful recruiter. Recruiting momentum belongs to brands that can prove their value every day.

#### Consider

* **Audit your brand proof points:** Ensure every touchpoint (website, social media, office space, agent stories) reinforces your core value proposition.
* **Lead with your why:** Clearly articulate the brokerage’s purpose and vision before discussing splits or technology.
* **Make agents your best recruiters:** Invest in the agent experience so deeply that your current agents become the most authentic and compelling voice for your brand.

| Top 3 Factors When Evaluating a Brokerage | Percentage |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Brand Reputation                          | 45%        |
| Leadership                                | 39%        |
| Culture                                   | 36%        |
| Compensation/Splits                       | 33%        |
| Technology                                | 30%        |
| Training/Support                          | 28%        |
| Leads/Referrals                           | 18%        |
| Other                                     | 1%         |
