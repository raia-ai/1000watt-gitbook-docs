# buyside breakdown research

## Introduction

Now seems like a really good time to get clear on what, exactly, makes a buyer agent valuable. Because if you’re an agent or broker, it is increasingly likely that you’ll need to make a stronger case for that value in the not-too-distant future. It’s also a fine time to disperse the cloud of ignorance and avoidance that shrouds buyer agent compensation. If you’re an entrepreneur looking to create value for homebuyers in a landscape that could be significantly changed, you need to know your customer.

For decades, the residential real estate industry has done nothing to dispel many consumers’ belief — or, more importantly, feeling — that buyer agent services are free. Our research over the past two years shows this conclusively, and is reinforced in this most recent survey. Discussion of buyer agent compensation, baked into the cake before the buyer even enters the picture, is often avoided entirely.

Whether or not this practice has led to artificially high real estate commissions is a matter of argument — something for plaintiffs’ lawyers and regulators to demonstrate. We are not joining that argument. This report is practical. Our goal is to help those who seek to prepare for, and find opportunity within, the looming change.

To do this, we asked 1,000 consumers who had bought a home within the past three years how they valued their buyer agent, how they understood the services that agent performed for them, what they knew or didn't know about how their agent was compensated for those services, and what they might do in the future with different choices.

## About Our Survey and Survey Respondents

On August 14th, 2023, we fielded a survey of **1,000 American adult homeowners** who had purchased their home in the last three years. We filtered out real estate agents, brokers, and investors.

* **47%** had bought their home in the past twelve months.

## Topline Findings and Takeaways

* **Buyer representation agreements are not necessarily a panacea.** A surprisingly high number of respondents report that they signed a buyer representation agreement with their agent. However, only **27%** of those who did sign such an agreement received a clear explanation of compensation from their agent, and **43%** remain unclear on how their agent was paid.
* **Buyers who did receive an explanation of compensation were more likely to question their agent’s value.** Buyers who did receive a clear explanation of how their agent was paid up front were approximately **25% more likely** to question their need for that agent during their buying process. This finding hints that greater transparency could possibly lead to lower buy-side compensation in the future.
* **Buyers view risk mitigation as agents’ greatest value.** "Helping weigh the pros/cons of homes" and "Interpreting inspection and disclosure reports about properties, and noting potential issues" topped the list of functions respondents valued from their agent. These considerations beat out negotiating with sellers and/or their agent, as well as providing guidance on offer price.
* **Younger (25-44) buyers exhibit greater understanding of the process.** This cohort was somewhat more likely to understand how their agent was paid, and more likely to think they, not the seller in their transaction, paid for their buyer agent’s services.
* **A majority of buyers are comfortable with buyer agent compensation when it is explained to them.** In response to a simple scenario illustrating how a buyer agent would get paid in a $500,000 home sale, **60%** of buyers thought the agent got paid either **“fairly” or “too little.”**
* **However, buyers are strongly influenced by framing that suggests buyer agents are unnecessary.** When presented with an analogy to car buying, and a simple explanation of how home buying works outside of North America without widespread buyers’ representation, a large majority of buyers were inclined to discount the need for buyers’ agents. This suggests new business model opportunities.
* **Most buyers would sign an exclusive agreement and pay for services out of pocket if they had to.** Nearly **75%** indicated that they would either **“be fine with this”** or **“have reservations, but would probably hire an agent to represent me”** when presented with this possible future scenario.

## Results

### Buyer Satisfaction

We began by gauging how happy our recent buyers were with their agent. The results were more or less in line with the NAR’s readings on this over the years. Younger buyers expressed slightly lower satisfaction than other cohorts, however.

| Cohort                | Average Satisfaction (1-10 Scale) |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **All buyers**        | 8.2                               |
| **Buyers ages 25-44** | 7.8                               |

### Post-Transaction Contact

1. Has this agent been in touch with you in any way since your transaction?

| Response | Percentage |
| -------- | ---------- |
| **Yes**  | 58.20%     |
| **No**   | 41.80%     |

Takeaway: **42%** of buyers reported that their agent had not contacted them in any way since their transaction.

### Buyer Representation Agreements

2. Did you sign a buyer’s representation agreement with your real estate agent?

| Response         | Percentage |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| **Yes**          | 63.40%     |
| **No**           | 32.10%     |
| **I don’t know** | 4.50%      |

Takeaway: A surprisingly high number of buyers signed one, but there is a difference between signing an agreement and explaining or understanding its contents.

### Compensation Explanation and Clarity

03A. Did the real estate agent who helped you buy your home explain, up front, how they were to get paid? (All Buyers)

| Response | Percentage |
| -------- | ---------- |
| **Yes**  | 54.70%     |
| **No**   | 45.30%     |

Takeaway: **45%** of all buyers did not receive an explanation from their agent as to how they were to be paid.

03B. Did the real estate agent who helped you buy your home explain, up front, how they were to get paid? (Among those who signed an agreement)

| Response | Percentage |
| -------- | ---------- |
| **Yes**  | 72.24%     |
| **No**   | 27.76%     |

Takeaway: Even among those who signed a buyer representation agreement, **27%** did not receive an explanation.

03C. Did the real estate agent who helped you buy your home explain, up front, how they were to get paid? (Among those who did NOT sign an agreement)

| Response | Percentage |
| -------- | ---------- |
| **Yes**  | 16.69%     |
| **No**   | 81.31%     |

Takeaway: **81%** of those who did not sign a buyer representation agreement did not receive an explanation.

4. Are you clear now on how the agent who helped you buy got paid for their work? (All Buyers)

| Response | Percentage |
| -------- | ---------- |
| **Yes**  | 25.83%     |
| **No**   | 74.17%     |

Takeaway: Retrospectively, only **26%** of all buyers are clear on how their buyer’s agent was paid.

### Perception of Who Paid the Agent

05A. Do you feel like you paid for the services of the real estate agent who helped you buy a home, or that your agent was paid by the seller? (All Respondents)

| Response                                                | Percentage |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **I feel like I paid for my agent’s services**          | 51.40%     |
| **I feel like the seller paid for my agent’s services** | 41.50%     |
| **I am unclear on who paid for my agent’s services**    | 7.10%      |

05B. Do you feel like you paid for the services of the real estate agent who helped you buy a home, or that your agent was paid by the seller? (Just 25-44 Year-Old Buyers)

| Response                                                | Percentage |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **I feel like I paid for my agent’s services**          | 61.71%     |
| **I feel like the seller paid for my agent’s services** | 27.29%     |
| **I am unclear on who paid for my agent’s services**    | 11.00%     |

Takeaway: Younger buyers have a stronger perception that they paid for their agent’s services.

### Questioning the Need for an Agent

06A. Did you ever think, during your transaction or since, that you could buy a home without the help of an agent? (All Respondents)

| Response | Percentage |
| -------- | ---------- |
| **Yes**  | 15.60%     |
| **No**   | 84.40%     |

06B. Did you ever think, during your transaction or since, that you could buy a home without the help of an agent? (Among those who received a clear upfront explanation of compensation)

| Response | Percentage |
| -------- | ---------- |
| **Yes**  | 20.29%     |
| **No**   | 79.71%     |

Takeaway: **16%** of all buyers report thinking they could have done without a buyer agent. This figure rises to **20.29%** among buyers who received a clear upfront explanation of compensation.

Representative Reasons for Questioning Agent Value:

* "I thought about it because without being told how much they were getting paid, I assumed that it was quite a bit and wondered if it were possible to do this without spending the extra money on an agent. I wish it were a little more transparent, because I don’t know what all the agent did for us."
* "We have bought 3 houses in the last 6 years and understand the process."
* "Because I wanted to save myself a little money."
* "Perhaps the seller's agent can also help me."
* "It doesn't seem that hard to do outside of the paperwork."
* "I honestly believe I could have done the entire transaction without the agent, and wouldn’t have had to fork out any extra expenses or waste time."
* "I found the house myself."
* "They just gave their opinion on houses and helped set up appointments which I feel could have been done without them."

### Most Valuable Agent Service

The survey results on the most valuable service contradict previous research (e.g., by NAR) which indicated buyers value negotiation skills above all else. This research suggests buyers valued **evaluation of homes, and potential issues with homes, much more**.

7. What do you think is the MOST valuable service the agent who helped you buy your home provided? (All Buyers)

| Service Provided                                                                                 | Percentage |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| **Interpreting inspection and disclosure reports about properties, and noting potential issues** | **33.40%** |
| Evaluating the pros and cons of homes I/we were interested in                                    | 16.50%     |

| Finding homes                                                                                    | 9.80%      |

| Providing emotional support, encouragement, or a sounding board                                  | 2.10%      |
| Other                                                                                            | 0.60%      |

7. Most Valuable Service (Segmenting out younger buyers, 25-44)

| Service Provided                                                                             | Percentage (25-44) |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Evaluating the pros and cons of homes I/we were interested in                                | **22.20%**         |
| Interpreting inspection and disclosure reports about properties, and noting potential issues | 19.35%             |

| Finding homes                                                                                | 9.57%              |
| Touring/showing homes with me/us                                                             | 6.92%              |
| Providing emotional support, encouragement, or a sounding board                              | 2.44%              |
| Other                                                                                        | 0.61%              |

Takeaway: Younger buyers place a somewhat greater value on negotiation compared to the overall sample.

### Framing the Buyer Agent Role

8. In countries other than the United States, most homebuyers do not have a real estate agent representing them in transactions and instead rely on the seller’s agent to coordinate the transaction and provide information about the home. What do you think about this?

| Response                                                                   | Percentage |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **I think it makes sense and seems simpler than having 2 agents involved** | 71.20%     |
| **I think it is a bad idea and leaves the home buyer vulnerable**          | 28.30%     |
| **Other**                                                                  | 0.50%      |

9. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: "We don't walk into a car dealership with a buyer agent representing us, and we buy from the salesperson representing the seller. There also laws protecting buyers. It should be the same way with buying a home – just buy from the salesperson representing the seller.”

| Response                | Percentage |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| **I agree strongly**    | 52.80%     |
| **I agree**             | 33.90%     |
| **I disagree**          | 10.90%     |
| **I disagree strongly** | 2.40%      |

Takeaway: Buyers, even those who rated their agent highly, were very swayed by these statements that reframe buyer agent services, suggesting either opportunity or peril for the industry.

### Informed Sentiment on Compensation

10. Currently, in almost all real estate transactions, the agent representing the buyers paid about 2.5% of the home’s sales price. This commission is determined by the seller and their agent before the home is listed for sale, and comes out the seller’s sale proceeds at the close of the transaction. How do you interpret this?

| Interpretation                                                                                                        | Percentage |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **The buyer is paying nothing for their agent’s services**                                                            | 35.30%     |
| **The buyer is paying the 2.5% that goes to their agent because the buyer is the source of money in the transaction** | 64.70%     |

Takeaway: A very strong majority (64.70%) view the buyer as paying for buyer agent services when presented with a clear explanation that frames the money in the deal as “seller’s sale proceeds.”

11. Do you think this seems fair?

| Response | Percentage |
| -------- | ---------- |
| **Yes**  | 94.28%     |
| **No**   | 5.72%      |

Takeaway: A very strong majority (94.28%) think the current compensation model, when explained, is fair.

### Value of Agent's Time

12. Imagine that you buy a home for $500,000. Before your transaction closes, your real estate agent spends 150 hours over 2 months helping you evaluate homes, write offers, and interface with agents that represent sellers. Your agent receives $12,500 for their work, which equates to $83 per hour. What do you conclude from this?

| Conclusion                       | Percentage |
| -------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **My agent was paid fairly**     | 55.50%     |
| **My agent got paid too little** | 4.70%      |
| **My agent got paid too much**   | 39.80%     |

Takeaway: **60%** either think their agent’s compensation would be **fair or “too little.”**

### Contemplating Future Scenarios

13. If you were to sell the home you live in (let’s say the price is $500,000) and negotiate a commission of 5% with your agent, half of which would be paid to an agent representing the buyer, the total sales commission to sell your home would be $25,000. What do you think about this?

(Note: The text for the results of Q13 was truncated in the source, but the context implies the question is about the fairness of the total commission when selling.)

14. Imagine you are buying a home and you have to pay your agent $12,500 out of pocket for their services. You cannot fold this fee into your mortgage. What would you do?

| Action                                                                          | Percentage |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **I would be fine with this**                                                   | 30.60%     |
| **I would have reservations, but would probably hire an agent to represent me** | 43.90%     |
| **I would try to buy a home without an agent**                                  | 25.50%     |

Takeaway: Nearly **75%** of buyers would still hire an agent, even if they had to pay $12,500 out-of-pocket and could not finance it.

15. If a buyer agent were to charge you $12,500 and you had to pay it out of pocket, what is the minimum value you would expect from that agent to feel like you got your money’s worth?

| Expected Value                                                 | Percentage |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **They save me more than $12,500 on the purchase price**       | 48.70%     |
| **They save me at least $12,500 on the purchase price**        | 22.80%     |
| **They help me avoid a bad home purchase (e.g., a money pit)** | 22.00%     |
| **They save me time and frustration**                          | 6.50%      |

Takeaway: The majority of buyers expect a tangible financial return, with **71.5%** expecting the agent to save them at least the cost of the fee on the purchase price.

## Conclusion

The findings suggest a complex picture for the future of the buyer agent. While buyers are generally satisfied and, when informed, find the current compensation model fair, they are also highly susceptible to framing that questions the necessity of the role. The core value proposition, according to buyers, is **risk mitigation** (interpreting reports and evaluating homes), not negotiation. The willingness of a large majority to pay an out-of-pocket fee suggests the value is recognized, but the expectation is high: a tangible financial return that exceeds the cost of the service.
