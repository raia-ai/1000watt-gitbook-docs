## Introduction

The homeownership story is evolving. A new generation approaches property ownership with different priorities and expectations than their predecessors.

Demand persists, but for different reasons. Homeownership isn't primarily financial anymore. It's about **identity and control** in uncertain times.

As the industry navigates internal challenges, a new generation of buyers is questioning a deeper premise: Is buying a home still the right move? Can I trust my agent to mitigate risk?

### Key Shifts in Mindset

| Shift                   | Finding                                                             | Detail                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Control over Wealth** | **36%** want ownership to control their space.                      | A mere **11%** prioritize building equity. Freedom beats finance.              |
| **Risk Perception**     | **75%** view homeownership as risky across all income levels.       | Yet, most want to forge ahead in spite of the perceived risks.                 |
| **Agent Expertise**     | **42%** would choose agents with first-time buyer experience.       | **87%** haven't selected representation yet.                                   |
| **Media Reach**         | Only **35%** watch real estate reality shows.                       | Just **18%** follow agents on social media – a sharp decline from 41% in 2023. |
| **Traditional Wisdom**  | Just **17%** accept established homebuying advice without question. | Traditional wisdom faces revolt.                                               |

Millennials represent **38% of all homebuyers** (NAR, 2024 \[1]). Their mindset isn't a market shift. It's the future. The professionals who understand and act upon the changing attitudes of younger Americans toward homeownership will earn their trust, and business.

## Key Findings

### Financial Hurdles Dominate the Homeownership Challenge

Affordability isn’t just a homebuying problem. It starts with rent. Rent consumes what could be down payment savings. Nearly half of renter households are cost-burdened, spending 30%+ of income on housing (U.S. Census Bureau, 2024 \[2]), making homebuying a perpetually distant goal for many.

The biggest hurdles cited by aspiring buyers:

| Barrier               | Percentage (n=856) |
| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Down Payment          | **33%**            |
| Monthly Affordability | **29%**            |
| Economic Uncertainty  | **22%**            |
| Credit Concerns       | **11%**            |
| Other                 | **5%**             |

_Note: Data points are inferred from the chart on page 5 of the PDF._

Perceived uncertainty in today's global economic climate (**22%**) exceeds 2021 findings, when neither pandemic nor climate concerns were primary homebuying barriers.

#### Disparities in Financial Barriers

* **Credit Concerns:** Parents worry about credit at twice the rate of non-parents (**21% vs. 11%**). Lower-income buyers (<$50K) express three times the credit anxiety of higher-income buyers ($150K+) (**18% vs. 6%**).
* **Education and Risk:** Higher-educated buyers cite 'economic and world uncertainty' more frequently (**24%**) than those with less education (**17%**). Knowledge, it turns out, doesn't breed confidence, it breeds caution.

What this means:

* **Talk to different buyers differently.** Tailor your messaging to reflect varying affordability concerns by life stage and demographic.
* **Lead with financial expertise, not listings.** Agents who solve financing problems win.

### Freedom Over Capital: The Modern Homebuying Motivation

Money blocks the path to ownership, but it's not what drives the journey.

People want **autonomy and control** more than equity. The top motivation to purchase a home is: **"I want my own place that I can change how I want" (36%)**. This surpasses wealth-building (**11%**) and concerns over rising housing costs (**10%**).

This is especially true for non-parents (**39%**) and lower-educated buyers (**42%**). Across all demographics, **emotional and lifestyle factors consistently outrank wealth-building as motivators.**

The motivation may be less about owning, and more about escaping rising rents, lease restrictions, and rules. This generation is seeking personal sovereignty.

**Biggest Reason to Buy a Home (n=856):**

| Motivation              | Percentage |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| Desire for Control      | **36%**    |
| Tired of Paying Rent    | **26%**    |
| Place to Raise a Family | **18%**    |
| Wealth Building         | **11%**    |
| Rising Costs Concerns   | **10%**    |
| Other                   | **4%**     |

_Note: Data points are inferred from the chart on page 7 of the PDF._

What this means:

* **Sell the personal desire, not just the math.** The investment pitch is secondary. Your messaging must reflect the desire to escape rent hikes and make one's own rules.
* **Segment by motivation.** Non-parents crave autonomy. Parents need stability. Tailor your approach accordingly.

***

### Young Homebuyers are Redefining Risk and Rethinking the Rules

Homeownership aspiration remains strong (**86%**). However, the **14%** who reject homeownership reveal a deeper story:

* **Maintenance responsibilities** worry **37%** of non-aspirants.
* **Mobility concerns** worry **15%**.
* **Investment skepticism** drives **12%**. One in eight simply don't believe real estate is a good investment.

**Risk Perception:**

* **75% of respondents** believe buying a home is risky.
* **Risk stops action:** **28%** of lower-income (<$50K) and highly educated buyers say risk concerns have stopped them from purchasing.
* **Risk tolerance varies:** **57%** of higher-income buyers ($150K+) acknowledge the risk but proceed anyway. **Risk isn't something buyers navigate around. It's what they navigate through.**

**Rejection of Traditional Wisdom:**

* **21%** reject the “max out your homebuying budget” philosophy (strongest among higher-educated buyers at 24% and women at 25%).
* **Higher-income buyers** ($150K+ at 24%) are more likely to question **“location is everything.”**

**Homebuyer Risk Perception (n=1000):**

| Perception                              | Percentage |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Risky but Still Pursue Homeownership    | **57%**    |
| Risky and Prevented from Moving Forward | **18%**    |
| Purchasing a Home is Not Risky          | **25%**    |

_Note: Data points are inferred from the chart on page 9 of the PDF._

What this means:

* **Retire the "stretch your budget" pitch.** Show them how to assess risk, protect their financial future, and make sustainable choices.
* **Target risk messaging by segment.** Higher-income buyers need wealth preservation strategies. Lower-income buyers need confidence they aren't making catastrophic mistakes.
* **Become a financial security advisor.** The agents who help clients navigate uncertainty will win their trust.

### Most Aspiring Homebuyers Expect a Difficult Process, Want an Expert, But Haven't Chosen an Agent Yet

An overwhelming **96%** of non-homeowners expect homebuying to be difficult (**35%** said “very difficult”). Younger and lower-income buyers (<$50K) feel the most anxiety.

Buyers value **advice (41%)** over property finding (**32%**).

The majority (**87%**) don't have an agent yet. When they choose, **expertise matters most**.

**Most Likely Reason to Choose One Agent Over Another (n=1000):**

| Reason                              | Percentage |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Expertise in First-Time Homebuying  | **42%**    |
| Online Reviews/Reputation           | **32%**    |
| Personal Recommendation             | **31%**    |
| Knowledge of Specific Neighborhoods | **27%**    |
| Digital Savviness                   | **19%**    |
| Negotiation Skills                  | **15%**    |
| Availability/Responsiveness         | **13%**    |
| Communication Style                 | **11%**    |
| Personality/Connection              | **10%**    |

_Note: Data points are inferred from the chart on page 11 of the PDF._

What this means:

* **Win the undecided before they decide.** Show up early with expertise.
* **Prove your expertise, don’t claim it.** Create content that solves problems related to contingencies, inspections, and appraisals. **Expertise without empathy is just information. Buyers need both.**

***

### Reality TV Shows Create Predominantly Positive Agent Perceptions

One-third of non-homeowners (**35%**) watch real estate reality shows at least occasionally.

Of those who watch, **60%** come away believing **"agents are valuable professionals."** Only **35%** see agents as "overpaid for little work." This flips the assumption that reality TV damages agent perception.

What this means:

* **Borrow storytelling techniques that work.** Extract what resonates: high-energy property reveals, decisive moments, and behind-the-scenes insights.
* **Turn entertainment into engagement.** Produce dynamic, visually compelling, and binge-worthy property content.

### 82% Don’t Follow Agents — The 18% Who Do Want Dreams and Trust

Most people surveyed (**82%**) don't follow real estate agents on social media. This is a sharp decline from **41% in April 2023**.

The remaining **18%** who do follow agents reveal their motivations:

| Reason for Following              | Percentage (n=181) |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------ |

_Note: Data points are inferred from the chart on page 15 of the PDF._

* **Play the long game.** Stop blasting ads and start building relationships. Be memorable before they need you.
* **Make market insights matter.** Break down market shifts and show why they matter.

***

One in five respondents (**22%**) have considered a career in real estate.

* **Parents** lead the charge, drawn to flexibility.
* **Women** show strong interest.
* **Education level** doesn't matter much. Higher and lower education groups equally consider real estate (**22%**).

What this means for recruiters:

* **Flexibility is your recruiting superpower.** Lean into independence, work-life balance, and income control.
* **Skip the degree talk. Focus on skills.** Training programs should highlight market expertise, lead generation, and client relationships instead of academic qualifications.

* Complexity (**24%**)

* Slow timelines (**9%**)
* Accessibility issues (**5%**)

Higher-income buyers ($150K+) worry less about affordability (**48%**) and more about paperwork and agent-related challenges. Higher-educated buyers are twice as likely to demand greater transparency.

**What Needs to Change in Homebuying (n=1000):**

| Change Requested                   | Percentage |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Make Homeownership Less Expensive  | **53%**    |

* **Make it easier, faster, and clearer.** Simplify the process and remove unnecessary friction.
* **Transparency isn’t optional.** Explain pricing, walk them through contracts, and eliminate surprises.
* **Know who needs what.** Parents want speed. First-time buyers want reassurance. Customize your approach.

### Trust in Real Estate Info is Fragmented: People Matter More Than Platforms

**Institutions still hold trust. People hold more.**

**Who is Most Trusted for Real Estate Info (n=1000):**

| Source                     | Percentage of Trust |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Personal Connections       | **44%**             |
| Real Estate Professionals  | **24%**             |

| Educational Content        | **17%**             |
| Traditional Media          | **11%**             |
| Online Communities         | **10%**             |
| Social Media Content       | **4%**              |

_Note: Trust is the combined percentage of respondents who selected 'most trust' or 'completely trust' on a 5-point scale. Data points are inferred from the chart on page 20 of the PDF._

Social media ranks last. 36% don’t trust it at all.

What this means:

* **Trust is the strategy.** Real estate is about relationships. Leverage testimonials, referrals, and real-world case studies.
* **Be the expert who makes sense of the noise.** Buyers don’t need more listings; they need clarity.
* **Referrals and reputation win over advertising.**
