**Original Research - August 2024**

## Introduction

Rising interest rates have deprived the real estate market of oxygen for more than two years. The cost of homeownership has moved beyond the reach of many, and traditional move-up/size-down market dynamics have been constrained. Many sellers are “locked-in;” many buyers are “locked-out.”

Now, after months of speculation, relief seems imminent. From a high of nearly 8% last fall, the 30-year rate average stands, as of this writing, at **6.73%**. A higher than expected spike in unemployment in July makes a significant Fed cut in September a near certainty. A continued downward trend in mortgage rates seems probable.

The reality is that rates are either at, or quickly approaching, the levels at which frustrated sellers and buyers say they can make their move. They just need the information and context needed to process this reality.

We also got a reading on other emerging market dynamics: spiraling homeowner’s insurance rates and extreme weather events. As you will see, these things are already significantly influencing Americans’ real estate decisions, and represent an opening for brands and practitioners to inform and engage.

## About our survey and sample

We surveyed **600 American adults** across the country in late July. We screened out anyone who worked in the real estate or mortgage industries, as well as those who owned their homes outright and did not have a mortgage.

Responses were collected the week of July 22, 2024.

## Key Findings

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Rate Awareness is Superficial

People’s awareness of rates is superficial, even those who claim they are preventing them from selling or buying. Nonetheless, it is clear that there is a knowledge gap that can be filled as rates fall, and those who provide that knowledge have an opportunity to engage these consumers and potentially win their business.

* Only **35%** of all respondents, and **40%** of those who own their home, had a “general idea” of the current rate on a 30-year mortgage.
* **63%** of those who say high rates are preventing them from selling have a general awareness of where rates are right now.
* Only **27%** of those who claim high rates are preventing them from buying report having this knowledge.

| Group                 | Awareness of 30-year Mortgage Rate |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| All Respondents       | 35% Yes / 65% No                   |
| Homeowners            | 40% Yes / 60% No                   |
| Renters               | 22% Yes / 78% No                   |
| **Locked-in Sellers** | **63% Yes** / 37% No               |
| **Locked-out Buyers** | **27% Yes**                        |
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Professionals are Missing an Opportunity

Mortgage and real estate professionals aren’t keeping their former clients informed on rates.

* **61%** of homeowner respondents who reported being aware of current rates got their information from “hearing or reading about it on the news” or from “talking with friends, family, or neighbors.”
* Only **6%** got such information from their real estate agent.
* **31%** got their information from their mortgage broker, lender, or bank.

This indicates that mortgage and real estate pros are missing an opportunity to regularly engage past and prospective clients with relevant information, thus missing opportunities for business.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### The “Locked-in” Opportunity is Large

* **44%** of homeowner respondents had a mortgage with a rate under 4%. For them, selling means forfeiting a historically low mortgage rate and payment.
* **18%** had a rate over 6%. As rates decline, the potential for unlock grows.

**38% of all homeowners** told us they would like to sell, but are prevented from doing so by high rates.

| Rate Threshold for Locked-in Sellers to Act | Percentage of Locked-in Sellers | Percentage of All Homeowners |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Below 6.5%                                  | 13%                             | 5% (13% of 38%)              |
| Below 6.0%                                  | 10%                             | 4% (10% of 38%)              |
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Buyers Think Monthly Payment First

Our analysis of locked-out buyers’ responses reveals a similar opportunity. **55% of all renter respondents** told us that they want to buy, but that high rates are preventing them from doing so. **34% of all locked-out buyers** say they would be able to buy if rates dip below 6%.

**72% of all respondents** told us that when considering buying or moving to another home, they think first of the **monthly payment** they think they can afford, not rates.

This is a reminder to all real estate marketers: Speak in the language of your audience. Instead of creating a marketing headline that reads “30-year fixed drops to 6.7%” try “Monthly payment for median home in \[your area] drops to $x,xxx.”

| Focus when Considering a New Home | All Respondents | Owners | Renters |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Monthly Payment                   | 72%             | 63%    | 76%     |
| Mortgage Interest Rates           | 24%             | 34%    | 19%     |
| Other                             | 5%              | 3%     | 5%      |
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Rising Costs and Extreme Weather are Top of Mind

These are emerging market dynamics that are now impacting how a significant number of Americans think about their housing choices. Speaking to these issues directly and with intelligence is wide-open thought leadership and marketing territory.

* Homeowner’s Insurance Crisis:
  * **40%** of owners reported a premium increase of more than 20% in the past year.
  * **26%** of those affected say this has “definitely” made them think about moving to another area.
* Extreme Weather Events:
  * **8%** of homeowner respondents “definitely” consider moving due to extreme weather events (heat waves, hurricanes, fire, tornados).
  * Another **12%** have thought about it.

* Convert any individual table into a card layout for GitBook.
* Break out recommended messaging examples (monthly-payment-first headlines) into reusable components.
* Generate editable notification/email templates that agents or lenders could use to re-engage their past clients with rate updates (keeping only messaging; no added claims).
