# 1000watt originalresearch june july 2024

## Introduction

So here we are. Less than two months from changes we don’t quite know how to gauge. Are we approaching a speed bump, or a fork in the road? Is eliminating the offer of compensation in the MLS going to cause chaos or mild procedural annoyance? Will buyers blanche when compensation is explained to them — and asked for — up front, or will they roll with it?

We don’t know. We have guesses, sure, but this is one of those moments when certainty is elusive, and probably, in any event, dumb. Listening, preparing, communicating, and adapting are the things to do.

That’s what this research is about: Inputs that shape outputs, signals that guide strategy, and understanding what your customer — whether that’s an agent or a consumer — is thinking and feeling right now. This report is part of our effort to help you, the 1000WATT Member, make that happen.

In a survey of **630 practitioners** in Mid-June, we sought insights into several questions:

* How many agents are changing brokerages now? What is driving this movement? How has this changed since we last explored these questions a year ago, and what can we infer from those changes given the current industry climate?
* What are practitioners hearing (and not hearing) from their clients when they speak to them about upcoming changes?
* Have agent recruiting efforts become more or less effective in the past year? What are agents responding to, and not responding to?

## Topline Findings

### Recruiting and Agent Movement

Recruiting efforts have intensified, but fewer agents are moving. **90%** of respondents had received recruiting pitches in the past twelve months, up from 79% a year ago. However, just **4%** of respondents said a pitch led to them changing brokerages in the past year, a significant drop from 27% last year.

Overall, the number of agents who moved, whether or not they were influenced by a recruiting pitch, declined from **32%** last year to **27%** this year.

Among agents who are moving, more now cite money as the reason. Last year, only 5% of agents stated compensation was the top reason for changing brokerages. This has changed dramatically: **23%** of respondents now cite compensation as the top reason, and **50%** of those who chose other factors acknowledged that money also influenced their decision.

This suggests that a contracting market has driven more brokers or teams to intensify recruiting efforts to shore up volume, but more agents are choosing to stay put amidst the industry uncertainty.

### Culture and Leadership

**"Culture/leadership"** was the number one reason agents changed brokerages, and also the top reason why agents were unhappy with their current brokerage. This factor has increased in importance significantly since last year. The report suggests agents seek strong leaders and healthy cultures more consciously during times of uncertainty and challenge.

### Early Consumer Signals

* **48%** of respondents reported that they are hearing about the NAR settlement and industry changes from clients and prospects. **10%** claimed that they are hearing about them from "a lot" of people.
* **70%** of respondents have begun explaining to buyers that they may have to pay them directly, and almost **60%** are receiving at least some pushback.
* **58%** of respondents have begun explaining to sellers that soon they will not be able to offer to compensate a buyer’s agent in the MLS. **77%** of the sellers presented with this reality indicate that they will offer to compensate a buyer agent outside the MLS.
