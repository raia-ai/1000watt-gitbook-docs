## Introduction

There has been much focus on buyers lately, understandably. But the seller experience has also changed, and they too are now called to think more closely about what agents do, and what they are paid for doing it.

Smart brokers, agents, teams — and those who serve them — would do well to revisit sellers’ needs holistically in this moment, and meet them in new ways.

Toward that end, we tapped into seller sentiment nationwide.

We first wanted to check in on awareness of the changes that took effect in August, and how people perceive agents and their value. We break out the results on these questions by age cohort and gender. This is something we have monitored consistently since last year’s Sitzer verdict.

We then move to how peoples’ selling experience compared to their expectations, what they found most difficult about that experience, and what they believed they hired their agent to do.

We also sussed out how much difference there is between sellers “liking” or “loving” their agent, and perceptions of value.

Several questions in our survey were open-ended, with responses collected via an open-text field. We then used ChatGPT to perform a sentiment analysis of all responses for each question, which we then had it summarize. In this way, we can provide you with insights from open-ended responses that leverage the full scale of our survey.

We highlight our high-level takeaways below but hope you also find your own.

As usual, a live Members-only webinar will follow up on this report, as will Actionable Marketing based on its insights.

## About our survey and sample

We surveyed 1,000 adults across the country who had recently been involved in a transaction. 650 of them had sold a home. Our results for questions focused on awareness of industry changes reflect all 1,000 respondents; those focused on selling issues represent responses from our 650 sellers.

We screened out the following:

* People working in the real estate or mortgage industries.
* People with a partner or spouse working in the real estate or mortgage industries.
* Active real estate investors

Several questions were open-ended. Responses were collected via free-text fields and then analyzed with ChatGPT to produce sentiment summaries for each open-ended question. Those summaries were used to extract themes and aggregate insights presented in this report.

## Key findings

### Agent compensation sentiment

* Awareness of recent changes to industry practices continued to increase. More respondents (**56%**) now believe real estate agents are paid too much than at any point in our three years of surveys. This is not surprising given media coverage over the past year but nonetheless underscores the degree to which value must now be explained and delivered more convincingly.
* More affluent respondents were far more aware of changes brought about by the NAR lawsuit settlement. **35–44-year-olds** ("elder millennials") are the most aware group across generational cohorts, with just **22%** reporting no awareness.
* More affluent respondents and those **54+** (older Gen X and Boomers) were more likely to believe agents are overpaid.

### Seller experience

* **33%** of sellers found the process to be “more complicated” than expected. This suggests that a fuller explanation of the transaction journey at the beginning of the process is warranted.

### Prepping their home for sale

* Cited by **28%** of sellers as the most difficult part of their sale.
* Common themes: effort, cost, time, coordinating contractors/staging.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Finding a real estate agent they could trust

* Cited by **23%** of sellers overall.
* Men more likely to cite this as the top difficulty (their #1 at **27%**). Women: **11%**.
* Age split: nearly **30%** of Gen Z and Millennial sellers cited this as most difficult, while only **9%** of Elder Gen X and Boomer sellers did.
* Implication: younger sellers gravitate to different messaging and may be more skeptical of traditional channels.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Dealing with disclosures, reports, and paperwork

* Cited by **19%** of sellers as the most difficult part.
* Suggests opportunity for better guidance and support through documentation and disclosure steps.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

* Sellers viewed “Negotiating with buyers and their agents” as their agent’s **#1 job**, followed closely by “Advertising and marketing my property.” Only those 54+ placed marketing above all else.
* Young sellers are almost twice as likely to negotiate fees than older cohorts. **38%** of all sellers negotiated a fee lower than that initially offered; **59%** of sellers aged 25–34 did so. The share who negotiate declines with age.
* Feeling good about one’s agent does not necessarily translate into valuing one’s agent. While **71%** of respondents “liked” or “loved” their agent, and **75%** felt their agent was worth the money they paid, **26%** answered “not really” or “definitely not” when asked if what they got was worth what they paid.
* Notably, **12%** of respondents who said they liked or loved their agent still felt the service was not worth what they paid.

We see an opportunity for practitioners and companies that can clearly explain and demonstrate the value of skilled negotiation and effective marketing — and for those who can reduce friction around home prep and paperwork for sellers.

## Conclusion

The seller experience is changing, and the industry must adapt to meet the evolving expectations and needs of consumers. Key takeaways:

* Value Proposition is Crucial: With increasing awareness of compensation issues, agents must clearly articulate and deliver demonstrable value, especially in negotiation and marketing.
* Focus on the Difficulties: Explain the complexity of the transaction upfront and provide support for the most difficult parts (prepping the home, finding a trustworthy agent, and paperwork) to improve the seller experience.
* Generational Divide: Younger sellers have different priorities and challenges (e.g., finding a trustworthy agent) than older sellers — tailor communication and service models accordingly.
* Liking ≠ Value: High likability does not guarantee perceived value. A significant portion of sellers still question whether they got what they paid for; this gap is an opportunity to better align service with perceived worth.

This research provides actionable insights for agents, brokers, and technology providers to better serve the modern home seller.
