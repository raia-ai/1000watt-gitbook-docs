# what sellers value in marketing

Source: 1000WATT Original Research, March 2021

## Introduction

When it comes to marketing listings, there are things that help sell the home, things that help sell the seller, and things that sell the agent to future sellers. Most agents we encounter readily acknowledge this.

The "story" a listing agent tells about how they plan to get a home sold at a price that is pleasing to the seller is listing presentation 101-level stuff. But are we telling the right story?

By asking people who have sold a home what they knew about how their agent marketed their home, and what they ultimately believed worked to help sell it, is our attempt to begin an answer.

## About the Survey and Sample

Our survey was presented to **600 respondents** across the United States over the age of 25 who have sold a home.

* **Gender:** 48% male; 52% female.
* **Agent Usage:** 88% of respondents used an agent to sell their home, which tracks the decades-long breakdown of agent/FSBO home sales.

We refer to the human beings who have, or may, buy or sell real estate as “people” here, not “consumers”. This latter term, while appropriate economic language, tends to numb one to a certain sensitivity required for good marketing.

## The Bottom Line

The biggest takeaway from this survey is that sellers "get it" more than we perhaps think. While some of them like tactics like a single property website or placing a home on Zillow, they recognize that these things come second to the **MLS in effectiveness**.

This awareness seems to exist both pre-sale and post-sale, but the after-the-fact sentiment shows a strong awareness that **agents working together, using the MLS, was the most important marketing tactic**.

This suggests areas of emphasis for agents and brokerages competing in markets where “office exclusive” listings are prevalent. People seem to understand the value of getting their home onto the MLS platform and in front of as many buyer’s agents as possible.

Most sellers are happy with how their agent marketed their home, but this sentiment exists amid a seller’s market in most areas.

Finally, 71% of respondents thought that the design quality of an agent or brokerage’s marketing materials is either “important” or “very important.” **Whatever the tactics, image matters.**

## Survey Results

While 9% of respondents appear to have little recollection of their agent’s marketing effort, most recall a number of different tactics.

Notably, 35% of people indicated that their agent created a dedicated website for their property. The authors question if, in 2021, the juice is worth the squeeze on this tactic, noting it is redundant, brings no audience with it, and can take a non-trivial amount of time to create.

The 14% of people who referenced their agent “putting their home on Redfin” is interesting, as Redfin is in only about 30 markets and is not a portal, but nonetheless registers on sellers’ radar. This supports the anecdotal observation that Redfin is widely viewed as a home search app/site, not just a brokerage, in the areas in which it operates.

The most significant responses are in the relative awareness of agents placing a home on Zillow versus the MLS. The authors would have expected a higher awareness of Zillow as a “marketing” channel than the MLS.

### Q1. What marketing did your agent do to promote your home?

| Answer                                               | Respondents (%) |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Placed my home on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) | 64.44%          |
| Professional photography/video                       | 48.59%          |
| Placed my home on Zillow                             | 40.14%          |
| Set up a website dedicated to showcasing my property | 35.21%          |
| Advertised my home on social media                   | 26.41%          |
| Send a “just listed” postcard to people in my area   | 25.00%          |
| Place my home on Redfin                              | 14.44%          |
| I don’t know                                         | 9.15%           |
| Other                                                | 1.76%           |

### Q2. At the time, which of these marketing tactics did you find most valuable?

The MLS not only came in at the top of the list, but the decrease between the “my agent did this” responses (Q1) to the “I thought this was most valuable” responses (Q2) was smallest for the MLS.

> Clearly, many sellers understand the role the MLS plays in selling their home. Agents often tell us that they do not talk to clients at length about the role the MLS plays in their transaction because it does not differentiate them. Every agent has the MLS. This is a missed opportunity in our view. If sellers value something, talk about how you put it to work for them, framed in a way that highlights your own skills. If other agents neglect to frame this as a major benefit, so much the better.

| Answer                                               | Respondents (%) |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Placed my home on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) | 62.68%          |
| Professional photography/video                       | 39.79%          |
| Placed my home on Zillow                             | 32.75%          |
| Set up a website dedicated to showcasing my property | 27.82%          |
| “Just listed” postcard to people in my area          | 19.37%          |
| Advertised my home on social media                   | 15.49%          |
| Place my home on Redfin                              | 13.03%          |
| Other                                                | 3.17%           |

### Q3. Overall, were you happy with how your agent marketed your home?

80% of respondents were either “happy” or “very happy” with their agents’ marketing of their home. This is not surprising, given that people generally leave a transaction feeling good about their agent, and a seller’s market has prevailed in most markets for close to a decade.

The authors suggest that this broad satisfaction presents a **competitive opportunity**. If most agents do the same things, with the same perceived value, then what new angles may be explored to win more listings?

| Answer         | Answer (%) |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| Very happy     | 44.37%     |
| Happy          | 36.27%     |
| Somewhat happy | 16.90%     |
| Unhappy        | 2.46%      |

### Q4. Did the design or quality of your agent’s (or your agent’s company’s) marketing materials matter to you?

Finally, how your marketing materials, whatever their effectiveness, are perceived by sellers matters.

| Answer            | Answer (%) |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Yes, very much so | 31.34%     |
| Yes               | 36.27%     |
| Only somewhat     | 19.72%     |
| Not at all        | 9.15%      |

## Conclusion

The research highlights the enduring and highly valued role of the **Multiple Listing Service (MLS)** in the eyes of home sellers, often overshadowing more modern or agent-centric marketing tactics. It also underscores the importance of **design quality** in marketing materials. Agents are encouraged to reframe the MLS as a major benefit they provide and to explore new, differentiating angles to win listings, especially given the high, but potentially complacent, level of seller satisfaction.
