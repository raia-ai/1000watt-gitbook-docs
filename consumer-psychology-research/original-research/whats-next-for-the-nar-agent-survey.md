# whats next for the nar agent survey

Original Research by 1000watt

This report details the findings of a survey conducted by 1000watt in partnership with BAM in late October, focusing on the sentiment of over 1,100 real estate agents across the country regarding the National Association of Realtors (NAR).

## Introduction and Observations

The year has been challenging for the National Association of Realtors and the Realtor brand. While NAR remains the world's largest trade association and a political force, the public perception, or "vibes," are currently negative.

The survey was fielded before the Sitzer verdict and sought to answer questions such as:

* Do people value their NAR membership?
* Why do they join?
* How do they view the sexual harassment scandal?
* What do they want from NAR?

The responses indicated a strong intensity of negative feeling, with the observation that "people are pissed" layered onto a "thick base of apathy." A key finding is that **86%** of respondents joined NAR because it was either **required by their broker** or **necessary for MLS/lockbox access**.

The report notes that the current state does not reflect a healthy brand, despite the worthy idea of NAR at its best—an organization that champions homeownership and elevates the real estate profession. The authors conclude that large organizations often require "large shocks to initiate change," and with the shocks having arrived, they hope the change will follow.

## Survey Results

### Value of NAR Membership

Respondents rated the value of their NAR membership poorly, with an average rating of **3.75** on a 1 to 10 scale.

| Rating (1-10)                    | Not valuable at all (1) | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | Extremely valuable (10) |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --- | --- | --- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | ----------------------- |

### Reasons for Joining NAR

The overwhelming majority of agents cited mandatory access or brokerage requirements as the primary reason for joining.

| Question                                     | Response                                                 | Percentage |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **05 What is the #1 reason you joined NAR?** | I had to in order to get MLS and lockbox access          | 58.8%      |
|                                              | My brokerage required me to                              | 27.2%      |
|                                              | For technology (Zipforms, RPR, etc.)                     | 1.8%       |
|                                              | For publications and research                            | 0.2%       |
|                                              | To support NARs political advocacy on real estate issues | 4.6%       |
|                                              | For the value the REALTOR® brand adds to my business     | 4.3%       |
|                                              | Other                                                    | 3.1%       |

Note: Among those who cited "other," the code of ethics and access to legal forms were cited most often.

### Consumer Understanding of the REALTOR® Brand

Respondents largely believe that consumers do not understand the difference between a REALTOR® and a real estate agent, a sentiment the authors note is supported by their own consumer research.

| Question                                                                                                 | Response           | Percentage |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| **06 Do you think most consumers understand the difference between a REALTOR® and a real estate agent?** | Yes, definitely    | 1%         |
|                                                                                                          | Yes, more or less  | 3%         |
|                                                                                                          | No, not really     | 34%        |
|                                                                                                          | No, definitely not | 62%        |

### Sexual Harassment Scandal

Agents expressed little understanding or sympathy for NAR's handling of the recent sexual harassment issue, which appears to have negatively impacted their view of the organization overall.

| Question                                                                                                                      | Response                                                                                                       | Percentage |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **07 Which of the following statements about NAR’s handling of its recent sexual harassment scandal do you agree with most?** | “NAR leadership should be commended for their handling of a difficult situation.”                              | 5%         |
|                                                                                                                               | “I may have done some things differently, but I understand why things were handled the way they were handled.” | 31%        |
|                                                                                                                               | “I disagree strongly with how this was/is being handled and would like to see more senior leaders replaced.”   | 64%        |
| **08 Generally speaking, how do you view this issue at NAR?**                                                                 | This is a story about a few bad actors and does not impact my support for NAR.                                 | 23%        |
|                                                                                                                               | This troubles me and has diminished NAR in my opinion.                                                         | 33%        |
|                                                                                                                               | This issue reflects deep, institutional problems that can only be solved by sweeping changes to NAR.           | 44%        |

### Willingness to Cancel Membership

A significant majority of agents indicated they would cancel their membership if they could retain MLS/lockbox access.

| Question                                                                                     | Response           | Percentage |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| **09 If you could cancel your NAR membership and still have MLS/lockbox access, would you?** | Yes, definitely    | 44%        |
|                                                                                              | Yes, probably      | 27%        |
|                                                                                              | No, probably not   | 21%        |
|                                                                                              | No, definitely not | 8%         |

### Enticements to Remain a Member

Respondents were asked what benefits would make them reconsider canceling their membership. The strongest signals were a desire to **increase the quality of membership** (making the Realtor label mean more) and **affordable health care** for independent contractors.

<details>

<summary>Selected open-ended responses</summary>

> "If they made becoming a Realtor actually mean something."

> "Would be nice if they could help provide affordable health care for independent contractors."

> "Raising the standards. I have never been involved in such an unprofessional industry as a whole. We 100% deserve the public's distrust."

> "Better leadership."

> "Stop the reckless spending on marketing, bloated salaries, and unnecessary headcount. Become a full time lobbying agency focused on protecting agents and consumers, as well as other housing issues — inventory, affordability etc."

> "A legal team that actually defended agents and brokerages instead of being a pushover. A reputation that makes me actually desire to be associated with the organization."

> "Holding unethical agents accountable. Higher entry point standards."

> "NAR would have to lobby with state agencies to double the hours of education it takes to become an agent. They would also have to enforce some type of internship program that all new agents are required to complete in their first 2 years. Experienced agents are tired of pulling the weight of new agents."

> "I don't think they can offer me anything. Their emphasis on adding as many agents as possible in support to profitless brokers shows me the system is broken. I created a business that doesn't need NAR or state and local and look forward to disengaging from all three."

> "None. The Code of Ethics is a sham. NAR is a membership driven organization. The system never gets rid of the bad players."

> "If they would actually advocate for us. I hate how they handled the commission lawsuit. They need to set better rules in place for our safety and require more education to become an agent. I feel like they really don’t do anything at all for us except take our money."

> "As a female, the sexual harassment and cultural problems at NAR are too difficult to overcome. I see no value in NAR and am fine if they disband."

> "A better focus on quality control. Hundreds of thousands of horrible agents have diminished the consumer's opinion of our industry. NAR is not at all incented to prefer quantity over quality."

> "I don't know that there is a single benefit that would immediately make me think, hmmm, maybe I should stay as a member of NAR. I would love to see higher standards, tougher education requirements to become an agent though. It is way too easy to become an agent."

### Understanding of Dues

A majority of members are unclear about where their NAR membership dues are allocated, suggesting a misalignment or under-communication of value.

| Question                                                           | Response           | Percentage |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------- |
| **11 Do you understand where your NAR membership dues are going?** | Yes, definitely    | 10%        |
|                                                                    | Yes, more or less  | 29%        |
|                                                                    | No, not really     | 37%        |
|                                                                    | No, definitely not | 24%        |
