# agent sentiment original research

**Original Research**

***

## Introduction

Whoever wins agents wins.

This is an enduring fact of real estate life. Technology may provide advantages, marketing moves the needle, operational acumen is a requirement, but talent rules them all.

It is for this reason that we continue to dig into what agents and team leaders are thinking right now. In last month's Original Research report we gauged the degree to which agents change brokerages, what they value from their current brokerage, and how they respond to recruiting pitches.

Here, we dig deeper into what agents are thinking about their businesses right now, what they use and do not use from their brokers, and where they source business.

We present these results in the aggregate, but also break out some responses into three segments: Solo agents, agents who are on a team, and agents who are team leaders. These profiles are vastly different, obviously, and the divergence of their responses is telling.

This report is meant to help you better understand the agent or team talent you seek. The results, carefully considered, should spark insights and ideas that give you an edge.

Of course, if you wish to explore this topic further, and brainstorm ideas specific to your business, book a 1-on-1 meeting with Marc Davison or Brian Boero.

## About This Research

In mid-July, we fielded a survey of agents nationwide and received over 1,000 responses. The survey was fielded in partnership with BAM, an innovative real estate media company with unique insights on agents and teams.

### Respondents' Role

* **36.51%** - Solo agents
* **33.27%** - Agents on a team
* **18.21%** - Agents who are team leaders
* **12.01%** - Other

### Years in Business

Over 50% of all respondents have been in the business for more than twelve years.

* **2.00%** - 0-3 years
* **30.41%** - 4-7 years
* **46.43%** - 8-12 years
* **21.16%** - 12+ years

### Age Distribution

Respondents were well distributed in age:

* **16.02%** - 18-25
* **17.45%** - 26-42
* **15.92%** - 43-61
* **50.62%** - 62-77
* **0.57%** - 78+

### Production Levels

* **53.48%** - 1-12 transactions
* **17.45%** - 13-25 transactions
* **29.08%** - 26-50 transactions

Production levels skewed higher than the general agent population. When we filtered for team leaders only, almost 50% were in the 50+ range. This was expected. However, agents who are part of a team reported significantly less production than solo agents. This merits further exploration, but we suspect this can be explained by the rainmaker/junior agent structure of many teams.

Respondents were nearly evenly divided between men and women.

## High-Level Takeaways

### Optimism Despite Market Challenges

All respondents showed a surprising level of optimism about their business given the current market context, even solo agents. We believe real estate salespeople are generally optimistic because optimism is a requirement for survival in a business that can often be brutally discouraging. We think recruiting efforts should generally mirror this, focusing on potential and opportunity rather than the anxieties presented by today's market.

### Third-Party Lead Dependency

Third-party lead dependency is high. A significant number of all respondents pay for leads from a third party (**35% of solo agents; 47% of team leaders**). And while both agents and team leaders expressed a very high confidence in their ability to convert leads, satisfaction with their primary lead provider was tepid. **The biggest complaint: Poor quality leads.** Leads are clearly a subject characterized by ambivalence, and it would be fair to surmise that many view them as a necessary evil. Brokerages that can address this (coaching, training, an internal lead program, marketing support) have an opportunity to connect with potential recruits on this issue.

### Marketing Services Adoption

Agents "adopt" their broker's marketing services at a high rate. Over **40% of all respondents claim to use the marketing services of their broker or team "very often."** Knowing how adoption of broker-provided tech frequently falls well below that, marketing support may be viewed as an area in which to place greater emphasis in recruiting efforts.

### Marketing Quality Concerns

Almost a third of solo agents reject their broker to team's marketing offerings, citing poor image or low standards. Respondent comments were strong and harsh on this issue. This supports what we see in our work with numerous brokerage companies. This suggests the need for a strategic review of marketing offerings, or at least more effective positioning of a brokerage's marketing function to agents.

### Marketing Means Staff

Respondents reported that they value marketing staff support over marketing software, data, prospect lists, predictive analytics, and personal branding. But staff is about the last thing most brokers want to add right now. What to do? Perhaps consider different staff that does different things. For example, respondents reported that organic (non-paid) social media is very important to their businesses, yet most brokers provide no support or services in this area.

### Website Strategy Gap

Agents do not have a website strategy. A majority of all respondents reported having an IDX website, but more than **25% report not knowing why they have an IDX website.** Team leaders were clearer on this point, and 35% of these respondents reported that they have an IDX website because it generates leads. Overall, we think this indicates an opportunity for brokers who have traditionally offered agents IDX websites tied to a company platform, which can often be expensive, dated, and functionally misaligned.

## Findings and Commentary

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Agent Optimism About Business Prospects

Inventory is scarce. Rates are high. Affordability is worse than ever. And yet... agents are surprisingly optimistic about their prospects over the next six months.

On a scale of 1 to 10, how do you view the future of your real estate business over the next 6 months?

* **All Respondents Average:** 6.79
* **Team Leads Average:** 7.11

As noted above, we believe that real estate practitioners are optimistic by nature, but one could also see these results as an indication that respondents believe we are at or near the bottom of the market, and that things can only improve from here.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Buyer Sentiment

Practitioners are an excellent proxy for consumer sentiment, and our respondents indicate the prevailing pessimism among buyers right now, and sellers' guarded optimism. Certainly, the opportunity to position your company or team's ability to help buyers navigate historically challenging market conditions is a wide-open opportunity.

On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the sentiment of home buyers with whom you are interacting right now?

* Results indicate lower sentiment scores for buyers.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Seller Sentiment

On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the sentiment of home sellers with whom you are interacting right now?

* Results indicate moderately higher sentiment scores for sellers.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Recommending Real Estate Career

Respondents were not bullish on recommending a real estate career to friends and family. It is likely these results (an average of **4.99** on our 1-10 scale) tap into just how hard it is to be in real estate right now.

On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely are you to recommend becoming a real estate agent to friends or family members who express interest?

* **Average:** 4.99
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Staying in the Business

However, our respondents themselves show little inclination to leave the business. **93% of all respondents, and 95% of team leaders are planning to stay in the business over the next year.**

On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely are you to continue working as a real estate professional over the next 12 months?

* **93%** of all respondents scored 7 or higher
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Marketing Services Usage

Roughly one third of all respondents reported they "rarely" or "never" use their broker's marketing services. When we look at solo agents only (agents who are not part of a team, or team leaders), that percentage increases.

How often do you utilize the marketing services from your broker or team?

All Respondents:

* **40.13%** - Very often
* **28.88%** - Sometimes
* **18.78%** - Rarely
* **12.20%** - Never

Solo Agents:

* **33.87%** - Very often
* **31.73%** - Sometimes
* **20.14%** - Rarely
* **14.26%** - Never
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Why Agents Don't Use Broker Marketing

When we asked those who responded "sometimes," "rarely," or "never" why they do not rely on their broker's marketing, their answers were blunt. Here is a representative sample:

> "They suck."

> "Our marketing support services create more work than doing it myself."

> "I'm already better at marketing than they are."

> "My broker's marketing material sucks. It's 'you can use the printers for free and mailers.'"

> "The materials they produce are not up to my standards."
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### What Agents Value in Marketing Support

Among those who do use their broker's marketing services, staff is viewed as most valuable, beating out marketing software, data, and personal branding support.

What is the #1 thing you value or want from your broker or team in terms of marketing support?

* **35.46%** - Staff (marketing coordinators, social media coordinators)
* **22.21%** - Marketing software (CMA, email platform, design software, etc.)
* **18.11%** - Data (farm/prospect lists, predictive analytics, etc.)
* **11.34%** - Personal brand design/materials
* **12.87%** - Other
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### IDX Website Ownership

Do you have a personal website with IDX home search?

* **69.11%** - Yes
* **30.89%** - No

The large majority of respondents have an IDX website, however a significant number (more than 25%) report that they don't know why they have an IDX website. Predictably, this is most pronounced for solo agents.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Purpose of IDX Website

What is the primary reason you have a personal website with IDX home search?

All Respondents:

* **23.59%** - IDX home search generates leads for me
* **35.31%** - I want my clients to search for homes on my site
* **8.83%** - I think IDX home search helps with search engine optimization
* **25.38%** - I don't really have a defined purpose or strategy for IDX home search on my website
* **6.90%** - Other

Team Leads:

* **35.80%** - IDX home search generates leads for me
* **29.18%** - I want my clients to search for homes on my site
* **7.00%** - I think IDX home search helps with search engine optimization
* **19.84%** - I don't really have a defined purpose or strategy for IDX home search on my website
* **8.17%** - Other
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Importance of Social Media

Social media is very important for all segments, with Instagram being the leading platform. LinkedIn, TikTok, and YouTube rated low despite numerous examples of agents and team leads using these three platforms with great success.

Primary Social Media Platform:

* **50.32%** - Instagram
* **35.71%** - Facebook
* **7.14%** - YouTube
* **3.49%** - Other
* **2.70%** - LinkedIn
* **0.63%** - TikTok

On a scale of 1-10, how important is organic social media to your business?

* Results show high importance ratings across all respondents.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Lead Conversion Confidence

All respondents, but especially team leaders, expressed surprisingly high confidence in their ability to convert leads.

On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you in your ability to convert leads into clients?

* Results show high confidence scores, particularly among team leaders.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Paying for Leads

Do you pay for leads (either up-front, or post-close referral fee) to a third party?

All Respondents:

* **35.18%** - Yes
* **64.82%** - No

Team Leads:

* **47.21%** - Yes
* **52.79%** - No

Over 35% of all respondents pay a third party for leads, and almost half of team leaders do so. These responses alone could arguably account for much of the power shift from brokers, to agents and teams over the past two decades. Zillow, Realtor.com, HomeLight, and Ojo account for almost half of this, with the other half accounted for by numerous other smaller players, most of which are referral based.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Primary Lead Sources

Which company/platform is your primary source of paid leads/referrals?

All Respondents:

* **34.42%** - Zillow
* **12.74%** - Realtor.com
* **3.79%** - HomeLight
* **3.25%** - Ojo
* **2.17%** - Mortgage lender (e.g., Rocket)
* **43.63%** - Other

Team Leads:

* **36.81%** - Zillow
* **14.58%** - Realtor.com
* **4.86%** - HomeLight
* **2.78%** - Ojo
* **0.69%** - Mortgage lender (e.g., Rocket)
* **40.28%** - Other
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Satisfaction with Lead Providers

While there is high dependency on third parties for business, satisfaction—particularly among solo agents—is fairly poor. "Low lead quality" was cited most often among respondents who responded 6 or lower on our 1-10 satisfaction scale.

On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you with your primary lead provider?

* Results show moderate to low satisfaction scores.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Reasons for Dissatisfaction

Why do you feel this way?

* **39.12%** - Lead quality is poor
* **27.55%** - Other
* **18.37%** - Not enough leads
* **14.97%** - Pricing/referral fee is too high
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Broker Longevity

Do you think your broker will be in business 10 years from now?

* **91.52%** - Yes
* **8.48%** - No

We asked respondents if they believed their broker would be in business in ten years. The response can be viewed either positively or negatively, but the comments from those who answered "no" are telling.

<details>

<summary>Sample Comments from "No" Respondents</summary>

> "The owners tend to live in the past and insist that what worked in 2008 works today as far as what customers want, marketing, branding etc. they also tend to change office policies every few months and do not support the new agents coming into the brokerage."

> "Our broker is totally unadapted. Still focused on print. 'nuff said."

> "The business model isn't nimble enough to meet trends."

> "Race to zero"

> "I believe the larger, more organized brokerages will take over those who are not and I believe our brokerage profitability cannot be very good based on how down their overall business is, but the top agents, including my team, are actually slightly up headed into the heart of July despite the challenges — including being in a building with a bunch of downers..."

> "Very dated, has not kept up with the times. Super old school."
