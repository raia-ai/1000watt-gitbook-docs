# the x factor consumer sentiment post settlement

**Original Research**\
**May 2024**

## Introduction and Observations

If we were a mainstream news outlet writing a headline and subhead for a story about this survey, it would be this:

> **Real estate consumers shrug off industry controversy**\
> **Realtors face increased skepticism, but value is still recognized**

The residential real estate industry has taken some hits over the past several months. This is indisputable. But the degree to which consumer sentiment, preferences, and future behavior has been impacted by the Sitzer trial verdict, proposed NAR settlement, and the media coverage they triggered has been the “X factor” looming large over industry discussions.

This research is an effort to define this factor and find insights that can guide industry participants as they navigate a period of uncertainty.

Our focus in this study is on **experienced real estate consumers** — adult Americans who have both bought and sold a home within the past five years. We made the decision to focus on the industry’s customers rather than its prospects.

To get the truest signal possible, we not only excluded real estate agents from our survey, but any professional participating in the residential real estate industry. We also excluded those with a real estate agent in their immediate family. We were able to segment results by age, income, gender, and other characteristics, and highlight differences along these lines when we found them to be significant.

In January, we released a study of 1,000 Americans who indicated awareness of October's Sitzer verdict. It indicated a significant increase in negative sentiment towards agents. Here, we get a more nuanced view, with some results that surprised us.

Below you will find answers to these questions (and more):

* How aware are consumers about the NAR settlement?
* What conclusions do they draw from it?
* How does that vary by age and income level?
* How do people value agents now, and for what?
* Will consumers demand lower fees?
* Will sellers be willing to help buyers pay their agent?

The answers are useful. But more important is what we think the answers mean, and how they should guide our actions.

And about that headline? Here’s how we’d write it if we owned a real estate industry news site:

> **Industry takes hits, but remains in the game**\
> **Consumers are warier, but still winnable in the wake of industry mess**

## About Our Survey Respondents

We surveyed **500 Americans over the age of 25 in mid April**.

All respondents had **both bought and sold a home in the last five years**. Real estate agents and any other professional involved with the residential real estate industry were excluded, as were people with an agent in their immediate family.

## Topline Insights and Takeaways

### Awareness of the NAR settlement is relatively low

Only **37% of respondents** had heard of the settlement and the proposed changes to industry practices. This is after three weeks of heavy media coverage and social media activity, and nearly five months of elevated coverage of the industry in the wake of the Sitzer verdict.

| Response                                   | Percentage |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Heard or read about the settlement         | **37%**    |
| Had not heard or read about the settlement | **63%**    |

Remember that our respondents here have both bought and sold in the past five years. They are experienced, vested real estate consumers with a stake in the game. That 63% of them had not even heard of the settlement news is remarkable.

**Awareness is higher among specific demographics:**

* High individual income (> $150,000): **52%**
* Baby Boomers: **46%**
* Millennials: **28%**

Only **14% of the 37%** of all respondents reporting awareness recall “very clearly” what the settlement issue was about.

| Recall Level                                                  | Percentage of Aware Respondents |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Yes, very clearly                                             | **14%**                         |
| Yes, I have a general idea                                    | **60%**                         |
| Not really, I can’t recall the specifics, just heard about it | **26%**                         |

We think this makes one thing very clear: The battle for hearts and minds is far from over. Industry participants that speak to consumers on this issue clearly and convincingly will find opportunity to shape opinion and outcomes.

### People value listing agents more than buyer agents, but by less than expected

Respondents — again, people who have both bought and sold — find agents more valuable when selling than buying, but this preference is not as large as one might expect.

**General Value Perception (All Respondents):**

| Value Perception              | Percentage |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| More valuable when selling    | **33%**    |
| More valuable when buying     | **21%**    |
| About the same level of value | **46%**    |

**Value Perception (High Income Respondents >$150K):**

| Value Perception              | Percentage |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| More valuable when selling    | **35%**    |
| More valuable when buying     | **32%**    |
| About the same level of value | **33%**    |

Significantly more high income respondents thought agents are more valuable when buying. This tells us that the gap in perceived value between listing agents and buyer agents is real, but not huge, and therefore not insurmountable. Those who can articulate value to buyers will find a receptive audience.

### Most consumers interpret the issue as procedural

Only **20% of respondents** who had heard of the settlement view the matter in adversarial terms. A large majority view it through a procedural lens. These results are significantly different from our January results on this same question, where nearly 40% of respondents chose the “ripping off” view.

**Opinion about the issue in the trial and the trial outcome:**

| Statement                                                                                                                                                                 | Percentage |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| The Nation Association of Realtors and big real estate companies are finally facing consequences for ripping off home buyers and sellers with excessive commissions/fees. | **20%**    |
| Real estate agents who work with buyers will now have to negotiate how they are compensated directly with those buyer clients, and this makes sense to me.                | **74%**    |
| Real estate agents are being attacked wrongly, and this trial verdict was wrong.                                                                                          | **3%**     |

We hypothesize that consumer perception has moderated because while a swift jury verdict signifies loss and culpability, a settlement signifies resolution, agreement, and conclusion. Again, we believe there is now a window of opportunity to shape opinion, and outcomes, in a positive direction.

### Negative perception is modest, but Millennials show the biggest shift

The settlement, and the issues that led to it, have negatively impacted perception of agents, and their value, but only modestly.

On a one-to-ten scale regarding the statement: "The recent lawsuits and legal settlements in the real estate industry have made my opinion or perception of real estate agents more negative."

* Average response for all respondents aware of litigation: **5.02**
* Average response for Millennials aware of litigation: **5.88**
* **16%** of aware respondents responded eight or above.

### Consumers still see value in a Buyer's Agent

Moreover, **76% of all respondents** believe it is worth paying for the services of an agent when buying a home. This majority decreases only slightly among respondents who have heard of the settlement (**71%**) and increases among Millennials (**79%**). These responses suggest that mass media coverage of this issue has had an impact, but it is mild.

Agreement with the statement: "It is worth paying a real estate agent to help you buy a home because it is a big, complex purchase requiring the expert guidance of a professional."

* All respondents: **76%**
* Respondents aware of settlement: **71%**
* Millennials: **79%**

### People like their agent, and agents in general

A large majority of our respondents were happy with, and would refer, their agent. More notable is the regard respondents have for agents in general.

Opinion of Real Estate Agents in General (1=Extremely low, 10=Extremely high):

* All respondents (average response): **7.20**
* Respondents aware of settlement (average response): **7.20**

The assumption that people don’t like real estate agents is not valid. We cannot rely on the comments sections of news websites or the acrimony of social media as indicators of sentiment. These signals amplify a vocal minority.

### Access to online information is linked to lower commission expectation

While our respondents liked their agent, and generally don’t object to agent compensation levels, they are easily steered to a conclusion that the availability of homes and sales data online should lead to lower commissions.

Average response to the statement: "In recent years, technology has made it very easy to find homes, and makes sense that the fees or commissions real estate agents charge should be less than they used to be."

* Average response: **7.02** (on a 1-10 scale, 1=Strongly Disagree, 10=Strongly Agree)

This highlights an area of significant opportunity for companies and practitioners who are able to demonstrate buy-side value beyond home search.

### People still prefer a contingent commission tied to property sale price for buyer agent compensation

A significant majority would choose to compensate a buyer agent in the manner that has been most common to date. Millennials and those respondents who had heard about the NAR settlement were slightly less likely to prefer this option (about 60% of these respondents chose the 2.5% option).

If you were hiring a real estate agent to help you buy a home right now, which of the following payment options would you be most likely to choose?

| Payment Option                                                                                                                   | Percentage |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Pay the agent an hourly rate of $100 per hour to complete just the tasks I needed them to perform.                               | **14%**    |
| Pay the agent a flat fee of $10,000 to provide any services needed during my home buying process.                                | **20%**    |
| Pay the agent a fee equal to 2.5% of the purchase of the home I purchase, with no fee payable if I eventually decide not to buy. | **66%**    |

Consumers are clearly willing to pay what one could argue is a premium for contingent payment. Given the complex, winding, sometimes dead-end path of home buyer journeys, it is rational that this option appeals to most people.

### Prospective sellers are conflicted about offering to compensate a buyer's agent

Respondents were evenly split on the question below. This near 50/50 breakdown held across age and income levels.

If you were selling your house right now, which of the following statements would make more sense to you?

| Seller Compensation Stance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Percentage |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| You do not have to compensate the agent who represents a buyer, but you may want to because it motivates more agents to find a qualified buyer, and also reduces the cash a buyer needs to purchase your home, which may mean they are more likely to offer the price you want. | **49.6%**  |
| You should not offer to compensate the agent who represents a buyer because that agent should get paid directly by their own client. This will reduce the total commission you pay but may make it harder for some buyers to afford your home.                                  | **50.4%**  |
