A Report by 1OOOWATT, November 2024

***

## Introduction

Everyone has an opinion on **NAR’s Clear Cooperation Policy (CCP)**. If you're reading this, that probably includes you.

If for some reason you have managed to avoid this debate, you can read the policy on the NAR’s website. If you want the short version, the COP requires that listings be placed on the MLS within 24 hours of being promoted publicly, while also permitting a property to be shared privately within the company listing it (if you sense a contradiction there, you’re not alone).

> The purpose of this report is to rise above what we think, or what anyone else thinks. We wanted to hear from **consumers**.

At **1OOOWATT**, we believe the CCP, while imperfect, should be maintained. We have explained our position at length, while recognizing the arguments of others. In short, we support the CCP for two reasons:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### We believe it supports the MLS

A secure, accurate platform on which nearly all sellers can reach nearly all buyers, and nearly all buyers can access nearly all properties for sale. The MLS creates the clarity and efficiency required for a competitive and open housing market.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### We believe there is significant risk in permitting private listings to mushroom

Permitting private listings, or listings not publicly marketed widely, risks making homes for sale more challenging to access and could persuade people to market their home in a manner that exposes it to fewer buyers — which feels hazardous given the industry's scrutiny.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

We hold this position having no direct stake in the outcome. It’s what we believe as people who care about this industry and the people it serves.

## Methodology and Context

**Realtors face increased skepticism, but value is still recognized.** But enough about our view. The purpose of this report is to rise above what we think, or what anyone else thinks. We wanted to hear from consumers — homeowners who are potential sellers, and homeowners who have sold a home in the past.

We think it is safe to assume that there are very few consumers stewing over the Clear Cooperation Policy at the moment. This is still an industry argument, despite some coverage in major media outlets. To understand where potential and experienced sellers stand, we needed to provide context. We asked questions that communicated the issues involved in the COP without getting lost in industry-speak.

We took great care to present questions to people neutrally. Intellectual honesty means a lot to us at 1OOOWATT. **Integrity is more important than winning an argument.** To that end, we used unbiased wording in our questions, and where we asked respondents to consider opposing arguments, we did so with balance. We also had a third-party consumer research agency review our survey instrument for bias. Their feedback was acted upon.

We conducted a consumer focus group to complement this report (the recording will be made available shortly). The conversational format of a focus group often adds nuance to findings derived from a survey, and allows us to see the impact of certain questions and arguments.

We hope these findings, and the conclusions we draw from them, add to the CCP debate in constructive ways, and help you or your company better prepare whatever your chosen strategy may be.

### About our Survey and Sample

We fielded a survey of **2,000 adult American homeowners** the week of November 18th, 2024. The survey sample was drawn nationally. Real estate agents, loan officers, or people working in any other capacity in the residential real estate industry were screened from our sample.

* **49%** of our homeowner respondents had sold a home in the past (referred to as **“experienced sellers”**).
* **51%** had not sold a home (referred to as **“prospective sellers”**).

We call out results by these two segments, and by generational cohort, where they differ significantly from the sample as a whole.

**Obvious but necessary notes:** We asked people about a home sale that has either happened in the past, may happen in the future, or is entirely hypothetical. Moreover, while we do get a sense for how certain arguments impact perceptions, and do in fact ask, on a key question, where the opinion of a real estate agent influenced decision making, it should be recognized that consumer sentiment on this issue is easily subjected to influence from brokers and agents. This is the stuff of marketing and messaging, and represents both a responsibility and an opportunity.

## Key Findings

### 1. MLS Understanding is Low, Especially Among Prospective Sellers

Significant numbers of both experienced and prospective sellers do not have a basic understanding of what the MLS is.

| Seller Segment          | Response: "Didn't really know any of this" |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Experienced Sellers** | **16%**                                    |
| **Prospective Sellers** | **41%**                                    |

Clearly, many sellers start the selling process with little to no understanding of what the MLS is. This presents an opportunity for agents to shape that understanding, or, perhaps, to advocate for a private listing strategy knowing that many sellers know little to nothing about the MLS, and how it may or may not benefit them.

### 2. Most Experienced Sellers Used the MLS

* **68%** of sellers recall placing their home on the MLS.
* **15%** can't recall whether they did or not.
* **17%** did not place their home on the MLS.

Most of those who did not place their home on the MLS did so because they sold their home themselves, or sold it to someone they knew. We estimate that **77% of all experienced sellers placed their home on the MLS**, with the balance roughly split from private or FSBO sellers.

### 3. Privacy is a Minor Concern for Off-MLS Sales

Privacy concerns moved only a very small number of experienced sellers to keep their home off the MLS.

* **4%** of experienced sellers held their home off the MLS due to **privacy concerns**.
* Another **4%** did so because **“my agent told me it was best to sell my home off the MLS.”**
* **9%** cited other reasons, by far the most prevalent of which was selling their home themselves (FSBO).

We suspect at least some of the 4% who cited privacy are reacting to how their agent framed the pros and cons of listing on the MLS.

### 4. The Primary Motivation for MLS Use is Reach

Experienced sellers who placed their home on the MLS were motivated to reach buyers.

* **65%** said they did so to **“reach the most possible buyers for my home.”**
* **17%** indicated that they did so because, **“My agent said it was best to sell my home on the MLS.”**

Distribution to popular home search sites/apps and reaching agents working with buyers rounded out responses.

### 5. Off-MLS Preference is Easily Overcome by Data

When presented with hypothetical off-MLS and on-MLS scenarios, **13%** of all respondents choose off-MLS. When presented with research showing **off-MLS homes sell for less money**, that number who choose on-MLS **grows to 92%**.

> We wanted to test the strength of people’s decision to sell off- MLS, and found that it was easily broken by one additional point of information.

Respondents who had sold a home before were significantly more likely to choose a hypothetical on-MLS option versus a hypothetical off-MLS option. **81%** of all these experienced sellers chose on-MLS (as opposed to 65% of prospective sellers). The experience of selling clearly makes people more likely to sell their home on-MLS.

### 6. The CCP is Viewed as a Good Policy

More than twice as many prospective and experienced sellers view the CCP as a good policy than view it as a bad policy. Experienced sellers are more likely to view it as being good.

We presented people with a simple description of the CCP, then asked whether they agreed more with statements explaining why it may be good or bad policy. More than **2.4 times** the number of respondents viewed it as a good policy than a bad policy. Experienced sellers were even more likely to view it as a good policy.

### Question 9: CCP Reconsideration with Office Exclusive (Page 19)
