# recent sellers speak listing agent value

## Introduction

Within the residential real estate business, the conventional wisdom has always been that the key to growth lies in working with sellers—to be a listing agent or brokerage. In light of the unfolding changes to buyer representation, this assumption gains added force. Those who cement or expand their listing business will likely be among the winners amidst the turbulence.

This research explored the seller mindset with this in mind, focusing on several key questions:

* What did recent sellers value from their agent?
* How did they choose this agent?
* What surprised them about the home selling experience?
* How did they feel about how their agent, and agents in general, are compensated?

The responses provide illuminating insights, including a few surprises.

## About the Survey and Respondents

A survey was fielded during the second week of October to **1,000 adults across the U.S.** who had sold a home within the past 24 months with the help of a real estate agent. Agents, brokers, and real estate investors were screened out.

## Topline Findings and Takeaways

### Seller Satisfaction is High and Rising

Satisfaction, like commissions, seems to drift upward as the market slows.

| Year of Sale | Average Satisfaction Rating (1-10) |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| All Years    | **8.18**                           |
| 2021 Sellers | 8.02                               |
| 2023 Sellers | 8.26                               |

The average rating was **8.18** (on a scale of one to ten, with ten being “extremely happy”). The increase in satisfaction among 2023 sellers (8.26) compared to 2021 sellers (8.02) suggests that **selling headwinds make the heart grow fonder**, or that recency correlates to positive feelings.

### Agent Selection: Personal Ties are Loosening

While personal ties still matter, their grip seems to be loosening, potentially due to the increasing number of options for finding, evaluating, and connecting with agents online.

| Agent Selection Method                                                                | Percentage of Respondents |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Personal Ties** (Friend/Family Referral, Agent is Friend/Family, Known as Neighbor) | **49%**                   |
| **Online Research** (Agent Matching Site, Researching Reviews/Histories)              | **43%**                   |

The findings reveal that while agent selection is still a matter of interpersonal connection for most sellers, this drives fewer choices than it did in the past.

### Listing Agents Excel at Post-Transaction Contact

**78% of recent sellers** said their agent had been in touch since their transaction, compared to around 50% in a survey of recent buyers. This suggests a high level of list-side **“lock-in”**.

* **83%** of respondents indicated they would use their agent again to buy or sell.
* Of those who would use their agent again, **16%** indicated they would "feel like I need to use them again" because their agent was a friend or family member.

### Selling a House is Either Easy — or People Don’t Know What an Agent Does

When asked **“what surprised you most about the home selling process?”**, the most prevalent sentiment was surprise at how **easy** it was. This suggests a failure of many listing agents to communicate their value effectively, especially since this group sold during a generally favorable market for sellers.

<summary>Representative responses regarding the "unexpected" ease</summary>

* "The process went off without a hitch."
* "The process went exceptionally smoothly."
* "It was fast and easy."

</details>

It is perhaps not surprising then that **28% of respondents** had the thought, at some point, that they could sell their home without the help of an agent. The reasons cited include:

* "To save money in commission."
* "Because the process did not seem that hard."
* "Because it seemed as if the agent didn't really do anything I couldn't have done myself."
* Note: Males were almost 20% more likely to think they could do it alone.

### People Fear Negotiation

**41% of respondents** thought **“the negotiation or back and forth with buyers”** was the most challenging or stressful part of their home selling process. This is remarkable given the favorable market conditions during the survey period and highlights a key area where listing agents can emphasize their service offering.

### Marketing Rules: Social Beats Zillow and the MLS

**“Promoting/marketing my home to attract buyers”** was cited as the most valuable agent service. However, the most valuable promotional tactic employed by their agent was surprising:

| Most Valuable Promotional Tactic      | Ranking          |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Promoting my home on social media** | **Top Response** |
| Zillow                                | Second           |
| MLS                                   | Third            |

This is a marked change from a March 2021 survey where the MLS was perceived as most valuable, followed by Zillow. This shift suggests that distribution on the MLS and Zillow may now be viewed as **table stakes**, and sellers increasingly value social promotion.

### Sellers are Fine with Compensation and Co-Brokerage

When presented with a hypothetical situation where a listing agent spends 120 hours and earns $12,500 (equating to **$104 per hour**), only **21%** thought the agent was paid too much.

#### Buyer Agent Compensation

* **76%** of sellers were aware they paid the buyer's agent commission.
* **83%** indicated that this practice **makes sense**.
* Of those who objected, the prevailing sentiment was: **“I think that buyers should be responsible for paying their own agent directly”** (68% of objectors).

#### Dual Agency

* **61%** of recent sellers saw **no problem** with dual agency. This suggests that the number of buyers who elect to go without representation rather than pay for it out of pocket could be significant if cooperative compensation is banned.

### Rate Lock-in is Real

**50%** of the recent sellers who currently own a home (sold and then bought) claim that **high-interest rates would prevent them from selling**.

Of these respondents, **61%** indicated that rates would need to drop to **4% or less** to make it possible to sell.

| Rate Drop Required to Make Selling Doable | Percentage of Respondents |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| To 6%                                     | 13.7%                     |
| To 5%                                     | 25.7%                     |
| To 4%                                     | 30.2%                     |
| To 3%                                     | 30.4%                     |

Clearly, the process of coming to terms with interest rate reality is far from complete.
