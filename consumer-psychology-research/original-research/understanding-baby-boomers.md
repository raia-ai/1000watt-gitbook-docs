# understanding baby boomers

## Introduction

Baby Boomers are a force without equal in American economic life.

According to the Federal Reserve, this generational cohort has nearly **twice the wealth of Gen X**, and over **eight times the wealth Millennials possess**. This is not just due to time; Boomers had four times the wealth today's Millennials do when they were in the 25-40 age bracket, and have surpassed their generational predecessors, the Silent Generation, as well.

Not surprisingly, Boomers also hold the most real estate wealth, and remain a major driver of housing market dynamics. According to NAR, this cohort represented **32% of all buyers in 2020, and 43% of sellers**.

The notion that Boomers are holding a disproportionate share of housing, and exacerbating a historic shortage of inventory, is culturally persistent. Headlines like these — "Baby Boomers: Rich With Real Estate and Not Letting Go" (The New York Times) and "Boomers are only making the 2021 housing crisis worse” (Business Insider) — have become commonplace.

Despite their outsized role, the industry often focuses on younger generations. This research aims to take a closer look, exploring issues from what people aged 58-75 see as the biggest impediment to selling, to how they view real estate professionals. We also compare some of these results with a survey of Millennial homebuyers in late 2021.

## About Our Survey

We fielded a survey of **600 people** between the ages of **58-75** across the United States.

* 37% of respondents were male; 63% were female.
* 45% of respondents were retired.
* All respondents currently live in a home that they own.
* No respondents are now, nor have they ever been, real estate agents.

## Topline Conclusions and Takeaways

### Seasoned and Sophisticated Homeowners

As a group, our respondents have occupied their homes for a long time. Nearly **45% have lived in their home for more than 20 years**, while only 28% have been in their home less than 10 years. This cohort has seen major market shifts, including the 2002 recession (when the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 6.5%), the Great Recession, and the recent period of historically low rates. They can be characterized as seasoned and sophisticated.

### Intent to Move

Only a little more than **20%** of our respondents expect to move within the next 5 years; **53%** do not expect to move in this timeframe; and **26%** might. This supports the narrative of Boomers holding onto their valuable homes and cheap mortgages longer. The service or marketing opportunity lies in addressing the needs of the persuadable "undecideds" who may be thinking of moving but face obstacles.

### Reasons for Selling

Of those who do expect to sell, nearly half (**46%**) anticipate **downsizing**. Perhaps more instructive are the responses of those who expect to move to be closer to children or grandchildren (**18%**). This presents a clear marketing opportunity.

### Biggest Challenge: Logistics

The number one response to the question "When you think of selling, what do you see as the biggest challenge?" was **"Logistics of planning and executing a move"** (**38.67%**). This response beat out "finding another home I like" or "tax considerations." One respondent's open comment, "cleaning out all my stuff," is a characteristic response.

> Clearly, people in this generational cohort find the mechanics of moving to be a very daunting prospect. Services like fronted presale renovations and cash offers have lowered barriers some sellers and buyers face, and one wonders what solutions could be developed for older homeowners who may want to sell, but simply find it overwhelming. If you believe Boomers clinging to homes is a problem, these results suggest a way for creative business people to address it.

### Impact of External Factors

**Climate change** and the **pandemic** have made Baby Boomers less likely to sell and move.

* **66%** of respondents said climate change made selling their home either somewhat less attractive or a lot less attractive. A "devil you know" mentality may be common (e.g., why leave the winters of the Upper Midwest for Sunbelt summers that are exhibiting more and more extreme heat?).
* **77%** claimed the pandemic has either made selling somewhat less, or a lot less, attractive. People are likely to remain in places where social norms and regulations align with their habits and beliefs.

### View of Real Estate Agents

Our Baby Boomer respondents evidence a strong recall and relatively high regard for real estate agents.

* **46%** of respondents could recall the name of the agent who helped them buy their last house.
* Of those, **84%** consider that person a **"trusted advisor."**
* **86%** of those who could recall their agent's name could also recall the name of the company/brokerage.

Many of these respondents transacted in a time before online listings, e-signatures, or even email. It is an open question whether such recall and regard will manifest in younger generations for whom the transaction is perhaps less "person-to-person."

### Brand Perception

A majority of respondents (**68.33%**) do not perceive much difference between national real estate companies or brands and local real estate companies or brands. Among those who do differentiate them, **local brands are favored (18.50%)** over national brands (13.17%). This suggests that the strenuous efforts of local companies to leverage this quality have been less than effective.

### Engagement in Home Browsing

This generation is significantly **less engaged** in looking at homes for sale. **55%** said they rarely do it. This contrasts sharply with our Millennial buyers survey from last year, where **65%** reported browsing homes either daily or "a couple times per week."

## Action Items

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Address Logistics

If you are looking to win the business of sellers, address what you can do, specifically, to mitigate the **logistical hassle of selling and moving**.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Target Family Proximity

Bear in mind that nearly 1/5th of this cohort expects to move to be **close to children or grandchildren**, and bake this insight into your marketing.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Develop Downsizing Expertise

Go beyond simply understanding that downsizing is a significant consideration. Develop expertise, a program, or services aimed at helping people think through a move to a smaller home.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Refine Local Messaging

If you are an independent broker or agent, don’t expect simple **"we’re local"** messaging to sway Baby Boomers unless you can articulate specific benefits this quality provides.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Focus on Listing Alerts

Focus more on informing older owners of current for-sale or coming soon inventory, as they are far less engaged in browsing homes for sale. Setting Baby Boomers in your market up with **email listing alerts** may be an effective tactic.

### Market Perceptions (Open-ended)

Respondents seemed to reflect the current complicated market accurately, with most people citing the following perceptions:

* Prices are high.
* Rates are going up.
* There is a shortage of homes.
* A recession is possible.
* Homes are expensive, and if you sell your home you have to move out of state to find another.

Representative direct quotes:

* "Home prices have jumped artificially high. Corporations/rental companies are making cash, no inspection offers on homes 200K and less, preventing individuals looking to invest in a home from realizing their dreams.”
* “You will make money on your home but you will also pay above market value for the next home you purchase.”
* “Prices for homes are at an all time high. The market is slowing down and interest rates are rising as well. It makes me glad our house will be paid off 3-5 years.”
* “A lot less attractive because of the personal interaction with prospective buyers.”
* “I don’t want to go into homes of people I don’t know.”
