## Introduction

There are builders who have consistently cultivated strong relationships in the Realtor community through both good and bad markets. There are Realtors who love working with builders, year in and year out.

But for most builders and most Realtors, the relationship is... complicated. It is often a function of necessity — an on-again, off-again thing, an arrangement characterized by wariness rather than trust.

This report won’t change that. But it should help you better understand it.

In September of 2025, we surveyed 600 real estate agents nationwide to hear what they liked and did not like about working with builders, and how they thought this collaboration could be improved for their benefit, their clients’ benefit, and for the benefit of builders interested in leveraging the sales and marketing power of the Realtor community.

We asked them to be candid, and they obliged. Some of our questions were framed as advice they would give builders so as to encourage constructive inputs, not just “pay me more” or “don’t steal my clients” (though we did get a fair number of those). Some questions were open-ended, which allows us, and you, to hear from respondents in their own words.

Some of what follows won’t surprise you. But that’s not how to think about this report. Look for the suggestion of opportunity in the findings, or for the idea sparked by a comment from some agent, somewhere, about how builders can do better. This is a thought starter.

Builders sell homes.\
Builder reps sell homes.\
Realtors sell homes.

Surely there is a way to align this shared purpose more consistently, to the greater satisfaction of all involved.

## High Level Survey Observations

### Good news: Both Realtors and their clients are very open to working with you.

Despite a fairly high level of grievance in certain areas, a majority of Realtors view working with builders in a positive light. These same pros also report that their clients generally react positively when they raise the idea of exploring new homes.

> “Selling new construction is a more straightforward process altogether and has inherent benefits for my buyers that are easy to articulate.”
>
> — Survey respondent

When we asked why these respondents viewed builders positively, the most common responses were the relative ease of a new construction transaction and, perhaps more interestingly, their preference for working with builder reps rather than resale home listing agents.

### Higher comp is good, but consistency and clarity are valued most.

Predictably, many respondents said they wanted to be paid more for delivering a buyer. But many also emphasized that **consistency and clarity around compensation were most important**, whatever percentage or dollar amount paid. This was most evident in the open-ended responses, where respondents frequently mentioned being unclear on what to expect in this regard.

> “Winning business from agents isn't about bigger commissions or fancier models. It's about removing friction and adding credibility. Make it consistently easy for them to look good.”
>
> — Survey respondent

### Communication is an easy win.

Approximately a third of respondents said that builder reps did not communicate well enough with them, or with their clients. We view this as an area of opportunity. Realtors are frequently judged by consumers on their responsiveness. Paranoia about ownership of a client can be assuaged by regular communication. Whatever your capacity for Realtor compensation, **communication can signal respect**.

> “If you cut my commission from 2.4% to 1% then make sure you do most of the work AND keep me in the loop.”
>
> — Survey respondent

### Make it easy for Realtors to know about and promote your inventory.

Many respondents asked for simpler, shareable marketing materials. Some mentioned speaking in plainer language, not “builder jargon”. Many expressed a desire for builders to share current or upcoming builds at their office meetings. Our results also show that Realtors seek or find builder inventory in many places, but in our experience, these folks work on one platform: **The MLS**. If you do not place your listings on the MLS, then you must take extra care to be clear, simple, and consistent in making these folks aware of the homes they can help you sell.

> "Quit making it so hard to work with you!"
>
> — Survey respondent

### Compensation may vary, but respect should be a constant.

In their responses to our open-ended questions, **respect was a current theme**. Many Realtors expressed the sentiment that they were treated well only when market conditions made them useful, that builders viewed them as a necessary evil, or that the value they offer is not appreciated. This too seems like an area of opportunity. Because no matter how actively you engage the Realtor community, or how you compensate Realtors at any given point in time, **how you make Realtors feel can be practiced with consistency**.

> “They shower us with love when sales are slow and treat us as the enemy when sales pick up. They’re untrustworthy.”

### RESPONSES: Advice to Homebuilders

If you could speak to a room of 500 homebuilders and give them advice on how to win more business from real estate agents, what would you tell them? (A representative selection of responses)

* “Seek to/encourage Realtors to be part of the entire process - not just the closing”
* “Visit our offices. Provide materials at local offices to share with clients.”
* “Tell me about your build to help me communicate with my clients. Ex: Are you always using the same subs, or constantly shopping around? Have a spec? Involve Realtors who are involved in social media to share the process with future clients. Transparency in pricing is also super important.”
* “Get your clear and concise marketing materials in front of us more often.”
* “Establish a relationship with the top team in your market. Stick to building and we'll market them for you.”
* “Regardless of the market, remember the value an actual partnership with agents brings versus being adversarial. Being adversarial actually looks bad in the eyes of our clients as well and often makes them feel that the rep is showing their true colors. Keep in mind that we can and will show them other options both in new construction and pre-existing homes so actually try to "win" our business.”
* “View it as a partnership, not something adversarial. Don't treat agents as pariahs and develop partnerships with experienced agents, not newbie or cheapest agents. This devalues your brand and the experience for everyone.”
* “I want to be a partner with the sales and construction staff for the entire process. I don't just get the client under contract and leave. Also, recognize the top agents and don't restrict their access to community amenities and models for content filming. I cannot understand why they don't want me to promote their community. Quit making it so hard to work with you! Get on board with new ways of marketing and working with buyers who potentially will buy their homes.”
* “Create resources for the agent to share out. This may include a list of current incentives, standing inventory, or product information.”
* “Be more aggressive about their products to Realtors. In other words, the realtors need to know what the products actually are.”
* “Contact agents directly to tell them about your community and what it has to offer. Have a realtor "open house" to familiarize agents with the homes and community features.”
* “Be more people focused and less product focused.”
* “Partner with us. We could exponentially increase your sales. We have your buyers in our databases! Don’t make us the side chick and dump us when the market gets hot.”
* “Being treated like part of the team with a client would be helpful and reinforce the role of the agent to the buyer. For example: Being included in communications, meetings, etc. by default.”
* “Be real with agents. They are human beings just as yourself so just try to appeal to them in that way and most should understand you clearly.”
* “Connect more. Come to meetings, engage with us. So many builders just meet one agent and talk to them one time.”
* “Stop the lip service saying you welcome agents, because you do not. If a client forgets to tell you they have an agent and then does so on another visit, do NOT shut that agent out. There is a bond and a lot of work that the agent did to get the client to the builder. Always include the agent on all communications with the buyer no matter what.”
* “Real estate agents are not just sources for leads. But are the gateway to a vast network of pre-qualified buyers and hold critical market knowledge that can inform a builder's business decisions.”
