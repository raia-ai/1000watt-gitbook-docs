# advertising consumer responses

**Consumer responses to real estate marketing and advertising**

**March 2022**

***

## Introduction

By now, Real Estate Advertising's Greatest Hits is an album all too familiar to us. The tracks unfold, on auto-repeat, in the background of our lives:

* Find your place
* Home is your shelter from the storm
* Real estate made easy
* Love where you live
* Search to close
* An exceptional experience
* Going the extra mile

None of these are bad, necessarily. They hook into emotions that we understand to be real.

But these archetypal messages may no longer ring as true as they once did, and are, in all but exceptional moments of creative execution, woefully undifferentiated.

That was our suspicion at least. One we wanted to test with consumers. To do this, we asked people to respond to an array of common real estate marketing and advertising messages. We then placed real estate ads from several national brands in front of them.

The answers were illuminating, and suggest that there is indeed an opportunity to make a different kind of music to play to a changing marketplace.

## About Our Survey

We fielded a survey of **600 homeowners over the age of 25**, living in the United States, who have bought or sold residential real estate in the past two years.

* **89%** used a real estate agent
* **11%** did not use a real estate agent
* **54%** of the respondents were male
* **46%** of the respondents were female

## Topline Takeaways and Conclusion

### Advertising Saturation

People are inundated by real estate advertising — **78% of respondents reported seeing real estate ads in the past 2 weeks.** This indicates that the value of such information, being very abundant, is also generally quite low.

### Broad Messages Are Safe But Not Effective

Messages that are broad (e.g., "we are your local real estate agents") tend to be perceived as marginally more credible by consumers, but are not necessarily more effective. They are likely simply less impactful.

### "Easy" and "Simple" Don't Resonate

People don't view ads that tell them that real estate can be made simple or easy as credible. They both know and feel that the process is neither simple or easy, and don't believe assertions that dispute that reality. They "call B.S." on such messages, to put it bluntly.

### Reality Check

The findings above align with peoples' perception of the real estate transaction experience broadly. **64% of respondents agreed with the statement "buying and selling real estate is too complicated and should be made simpler."** Interestingly, 30% disagreed, and found that "real estate is too important to be simplified." Almost all respondents recognize the fundamental gravity and complexity of buying or selling a home.

### Gender Differences

Men responded significantly better to forceful and specific claims (e.g., "We'll sell your house faster and for less money") or messages that communicate rankings or performance (e.g., "We are #1 in real estate sales") than did women.

Our Principal Conclusion

Acknowledge the truth people hold within them, find connection in candor, and build trust through recognizing reality as people see and feel it.

If buying or selling a home is complex and sometimes hard, don't tell people it's "simple" or "easy." Make it clear you understand what they are likely thinking and feeling, then tell them how you can address those things better than anyone else.

The Greatest Hits may still be good to play once in a while, but play them too much and people will tune them out. It's time for some new music.

## Results and Analysis

### General Awareness and Perception of Advertising

**Have you seen any real estate ads in the past 2 weeks?**

* **78.33%** - Yes
* **13.33%** - No
* **8.33%** - I can't recall

Over 78% of respondents said they had seen real estate ads in the past 2 weeks.

If this seems high, consider what surrounds us: TV ads from national real estate brands and proptech companies like Opendoor, Realtor.com, and Zillow; direct mail from local agents; bus bench and billboard ads; online display and social advertising; in many markets, real estate ads appear on shopping carts!

**Real estate messaging is ambient.**

### Trust in Advertising Generally

**In general, do you believe that most ads are truthful?**

* **52.17%** - I believe they are somewhat truthful
* **32.00%** - Yes, I generally believe they are truthful
* **15.83%** - I believe most ads are not truthful

This tracks, broadly, with broader research on trust and advertising.

## Common Real Estate Messages and Perceptions of Credibility

Next, we presented our respondents with some of the most commonly used real estate messages and asked them to determine whether or not they were believable.

### Most Believable

* **"Get a free market analysis"**
* **"We are your local real estate experts"**

The most anodyne messages — those that do not make bold claims — were processed as more credible than those that were assertive.

### Least Believable

* **"Buy or sell your home hassle-free"**
* **"The easiest move you'll ever make"**

These messages, and marketing and ad campaigns built around them, don't seem to pass the "B.S. test".

### Detailed Credibility Rankings

Rank the following statement from 1 to 5 (1 being the LEAST believable, 5 being the MOST believable)

| Statement                                          | 1 - Least believable |      2 |      3 |      4 | 5 - Most believable |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------: | -----: | -----: | -----: | ------------------: |

| "The easiest move you'll ever make"                |               14.00% | 17.83% | 26.67% | 23.17% |              18.33% |
| "See homes before anyone else"                     |               12.17% | 16.33% | 28.33% | 26.50% |              16.67% |
| "No one sells more real estate than we do"         |               11.17% | 19.17% | 30.83% | 20.50% |              18.33% |
| "We have access to homes that are not on the MLS"  |                9.17% | 15.83% | 28.17% | 27.67% |              19.17% |
| "Sell your home fast for the most amount of money" |                8.67% | 14.83% | 30.83% | 24.67% |              21.00% |
| "Get a free market analysis"                       |                6.17% | 11.83% | 26.50% | 30.00% |              25.50% |
| "We are your local real estate experts"            |                5.17% | 12.00% | 28.50% | 34.50% |              19.83% |

## Testing Real Estate Ads

We were curious how specific ads made our respondents feel.

<details>

<summary>Coldwell Banker: "Guiding You Home Since 1906"</summary>

**What does this ad make you feel about real estate agents?**

* **29.52%** - Comfort
* **27.01%** - Trust
* **22.79%** - Safety
* **7.70%** - Skeptical
* **7.70%** - Unsure
* **5.11%** - Bored
* **0.16%** - Other

The top three responses were Comfort, Trust, and Safety.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Compass: "Guiding You Home"</summary>

**What does this ad make you feel about real estate agents?**

* **24.08%** - Comfort
* **20.86%** - Trust
* **20.14%** - Safety
* **13.70%** - Unsure
* **13.43%** - Skeptical
* **6.98%** - Bored
* **0.81%** - Other

The Compass ad had similar top categories but twice as many Skeptical responses compared to Coldwell Banker.

Our hypothesis: The Coldwell Banker ad's specificity ("since 1906") increases credibility by signaling tenure, experience, and competence.

</details>

<details>

<summary>RE/MAX: "Don't worry, we've done this a million times"</summary>

**What does this ad make you feel about real estate agents?**

* **26.33%** - Trust
* **24.93%** - Comfort
* **21.01%** - Safety
* **11.42%** - Skeptical
* **8.63%** - Unsure
* **7.06%** - Bored
* **0.61%** - Other

Respondents trusted this ad because it communicates experience and acknowledges that buying/selling isn't easy. It is rooted in truth.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Century 21: "Relentless Opens Doors and Closes Deals"</summary>

**What does this ad make you feel about real estate agents?**

* **19.58%** - Skeptical
* **19.39%** - Trust
* **19.30%** - Comfort
* **16.82%** - Unsure
* **16.54%** - Safety
* **7.08%** - Bored
* **1.29%** - Other

Skeptical, Trust, and Comfort were nearly even. Many free-form "other" responses said the ad left them feeling **confused**.

Hypothesis: Some real estate ads are written primarily for industry peers (agents) rather than consumers, producing confusion and mixed responses.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Rocket Mortgage: "Push button, get mortgage"</summary>

We first asked: **Have you ever applied for a mortgage or a refinance online?**

* **66.83%** - Yes
* **33.17%** - No

**What does the phrase "push button, get mortgage" make you think?**

* **60.00%** - There must be a catch
* **38.83%** - Sounds great
* **1.17%** - Other

Direct experience led many respondents to call B.S. on this claim; 60% suspected a catch. The campaign was short-lived.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Redfin: "Find homes first" and "Sell for more than the home next door"</summary>

**Is this believable?**

* **47.00%** - Somewhat believable
* **37.17%** - Yes
* **15.83%** - No

Gender difference: **47% of men** said Redfin's messaging was believable vs **25% of women**.

Hypothesis: Men tend to respond better to aggressive, competitive claims.

</details>

<details>

<summary>iBuyers: Opendoor and Offerpad</summary>

Promises like a free offer in 48 hours (Opendoor) or a cash offer in 24 hours (Offerpad) most commonly produced responses:

* **"Skeptical"**
* **"Too good to be true"**
* **"There must be a catch"**

Notable free-form responses included concerns that these offers imply below-market prices, lack of inspection, or pressure to accept less for speed.

## The Complexity Question

Respondents told us marketing promising a "hassle-free" or "easy" sale is least believable. They are skeptical of a process that seems "too easy."

**Do you think that buying or selling real estate should be easier or simpler?**

* **63.83%** - Yes, it's too complicated and there are too many steps involved
* **30.33%** - No, it is too important a purchase to be simplified
* **5.83%** - Unsure

Both "yes" and "no" responses share a recognition: **It's not easy or simple.**

Suggested marketer approach based on these results: acknowledge the complexity and emotional weight people feel, then explain specifically how you can help because of concrete, differentiated reasons.

## Conclusion

Every brand is different. So is every market. This research is not meant to be point-blank prescriptive, but to offer inputs and insights you may not have heard before so you can form hypotheses to test.

You may wish to schedule a 1 on 1 meeting with us (a free Inside member benefit) to discuss this relative to your specific situation.
