## INTRODUCTION

Imagine this:

You are selling something 95% of people aged 20-42 want to buy. They want to buy this thing for reasons that are rooted in the most powerful emotional territories of security and self-actualization.

These young people are so desirous of the thing you sell that 68% of them view it online at least twice per week. 41% follow people on social media who, like you, sell this product.

Many of those who want what you are selling face significant challenges attaining it, but 37% of them expect to get help from family to pay for it. And many have faulty assumptions about what it takes to buy from which they can be easily disabused.

This world, which is hardly imaginary, is your oyster.

The market continues to feel sluggish and locked-up in many markets, but the optimistic framing above isn’t delusional. It’s the reality reflected in our newest survey.

Below you will find sentiment that belies the claim that homeownership has lost its luster for young people; you will see that younger generations hold real estate agents in higher regard than those that came before them; and you will gain a better understanding about how you might engage younger adults with your marketing.

## ABOUT OUR SURVEY AND SURVEY RESPONDENTS

On March 10, 2023, we surveyed 600 people aged 20-42 (Millennials and older Gen Z individuals) from across the country who do not yet own a home.

* **24%** live with family; **76%** rent independently.

We asked respondents a handful of the same questions we asked in our August 2021 survey of young renters so as to track certain attitudes over time.

## TOPLINE FINDINGS AND TAKEAWAYS

Despite the daunting reality of high rates and high prices, and the corresponding cultural awareness of an affordability crisis, **95% of respondents express a desire to own a home**. This is up from 91% in our August 2021 survey.

Most respondents are motivated by emotional/non-rational sentiments in their desire. “Pride of ownership” and “a place for me and my family to call home” outweigh “good investment/builds wealth” significantly. Moreover, only 26% clearly view where they currently live as “home,” and 68% think that ownership is required for a “place to truly feel like home.” It is clear that marketing to this cohort should be directed largely towards the heart.

Consistent with several of our earlier studies, respondents here gravitate to messaging that is decidedly conditional. Put bluntly, people have a sensitive “B.S. detector.” For example, “Now may be a good time to buy a home if you truly desire to own your own place and can negotiate good terms with a seller” was viewed as far more credible than “Now is a great time to buy because prices have stopped rising.”

Respondents exhibit a fairly sound understanding of current market conditions. Broad, open-ended responses to “what have you heard about the real estate market lately?” suggest an awareness that the market is still challenging for buyers, but when asked about their perception of homes’ list prices, most understood that negotiating terms is often possible now, and only **16% believe they have to pay more than list price**. This suggests a clear marketing opportunity for those who choose to focus on their ability to negotiate on behalf of buyers.

**37% of respondents said they anticipated getting help from parents or family when they buy a home.** The same amount said this was “possible.” Only 26% responded “no.” Clearly, home buying for younger adults is a multigenerational affair. While it would require great sensitivity, it does not seem preposterous to consider marketing to both Gen Z, Millennials and their Gen X or Baby Boomer parents along these lines.

## RESULTS

We first wanted to understand what our respondents thought and knew about the market right now, so we asked “What have you heard about the real estate market lately,” and requested open-ended answers.

Overall, the responses exhibit a recognition that buying a home is very challenging right now, which is unsurprising. But there are many responses that show confusion or conflict around what’s actually happening, with several respondents noting that home prices remain high, but that a “crash” is coming.

In short, respondents are discouraged and confused. The door is open for problem solving and clarity.

<summary>Sample of open-ended responses</summary>

* I hear mixed things. I still hear that it’s impossible for young people to buy houses, but I also hear that another house market crash is coming.
* That it is very expensive.
* That interest rates are high!
* I have heard that it has become less tenable for young people to buy homes for reasonable prices.
* I’ve heard it’s really bad with the market about to collapse and not a lot of people selling their houses.
* It seems like big companies are outbidding regular people to purchase rental properties.
* Millennials are going to have a terrible time trying to buy houses going forward.
* I’ve heard that it’s really hard to purchase a house right now and everything’s really expensive.

### Desire for Homeownership

We then ask our baseline question about desire for homeownership. One could view this as like asking a 6 year-old if they’d like ice cream, but given the volume of stories about “renter nation,” or young people having a diminished desire for homeownership, this results here are nonetheless astounding:

| Question                                               | Answer | Answer (%) |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ---------- |
| Do you want to buy a home at some point in the future? | Yes    | 95.50%     |
|                                                        | No     | 4.50%      |

### Perception of Real Estate Agents

We also asked respondents to compare their perception of real estate agents to other professionals.

| Question                                                             | Answer         | Answer (%) |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| Compared to other professionals, how do you view real estate agents? | Better         | 26.67%     |
|                                                                      | About the same | 58.00%     |
|                                                                      | Worse          | 15.33%     |

This is a significant finding. In a 2018 survey, only 16% of respondents viewed agents as "better." The perception of real estate agents among younger generations is improving.

### Homeownership as a Requirement for "Home"

We asked respondents about their definition of “home.”

| Question                                                                 | Answer | Answer (%) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ---------- |
| Do you think you need to own your home for it to truly feel like "home"? | Yes    | 68.33%     |
|                                                                          | No     | 31.67%     |

### Current Housing Situation

| Question                                              | Answer | Answer (%) |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Do you view your current housing situation as "home"? | Yes    | 26.33%     |
|                                                       | No     | 73.67%     |

### Social Media Engagement with Agents

Finally, we sought to understand the degree to which respondents were aware of, and how they respond to, real estate agents on social media. Astoundingly, **41% said they follow agents** and another **36% “sometimes come across” agents** on social media. The sheer volume of agents (approximately 1.5 million as of this writing) and the proliferation of reality real estate shows are likely at play here, but this nonetheless suggests that establishing competence in these channels is important.

| Question                                                           | Answer                                                                    | Answer (%) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Do you follow, or come across, real estate agents on social media? | Yes, I follow a real estate or agent on social media                      | 41.00%     |
|                                                                    | Yes, I sometimes come across real estate agents on social media           | 36.17%     |
|                                                                    | No, I don’t follow real estate agents on social media or come across them | 22.83%     |

| Question                                                               | Answer                                                             | Answer (%) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| What is your general impression of real estate agents on social media? | Good — I find their posts to be either informative or entertaining | 84.55%     |
|                                                                        | Neutral — I don’t feel strongly either way                         | 14.23%     |
|                                                                        | Bad — I find their posts to be confusing or irritating             | 1.22%      |

## CONCLUSION

Yes, there is much to find encouraging in these results. But the challenges young people face - people who very much want to own a home - are nonetheless daunting. Good marketing can’t lower interest rates, or build more houses. But it can help you connect with those among this cohort who become capable of surmounting those challenges.

Millions of Gen Z and Millennial Americans will buy homes in the coming years.

Those brokers and agents who take the time to understand them, help them solve their problems, and give them candid advice, will be their real estate professionals.
