### The State of Denial

The initial phase of market disruption is often characterized by **widespread denial**. Established players, comfortable in their market positions, tend to dismiss new threats as temporary anomalies or niche concerns. This psychological barrier prevents timely strategic adjustments.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### The Cost of Inaction

Following denial, a period of **inaction** sets in. Companies recognize the threat but are paralyzed by the scale of change required. This delay is costly, allowing agile competitors to gain significant market share.

**Key factors contributing to inaction include:**

* Organizational inertia and resistance to change.
* Fear of cannibalizing existing revenue streams.
* Lack of clear leadership and strategic vision.
{% endstep %}

### Seizing the Opportunity

The final stage is the realization of **opportunity**. Companies that break free from denial and inaction can leverage the disruption to their advantage. This requires bold investment in new technologies, a customer-centric approach, and a willingness to embrace risk.
