# buyer expectations post settlement

**Original Research**\
**October 2024**

## Introduction

This report is the first step in creating clarity around a new reality in real estate. We believe a skilled agent, possessed of a clear message explaining the potential complexities or unexpected challenges that effectively aligns their value with consumer expectations, should earn buyer agent compensation.

The current real estate transaction process, especially in this new era of commission-related changes, is often viewed as a whole. What we need to look at is: **What do buyers expect from their agent?**

Our qualitative data, gleaned from numerous conversations with consumers, indicates that many consumers are now more inclined to assess an agent's value based on the delivery of service, rather than simply the final sale price. Good agents can thrive in such an environment.

## The New Reality

Consumer expectations for service delivery are much higher than they used to be.

### What Buyers Expect from Their Agent

Buyers are now more involved and informed. They are looking for agents who can navigate the complexities of the post-settlement landscape.

| Agent Role         | Buyer Expectation                                          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Negotiator**     | Negotiate with sellers and their agents.                   |
| **Advisor**        | Provide expert advice and guidance throughout the process. |
| **Advocate**       | Act as a strong advocate for the buyer's best interests.   |
| **Communicator**   | Clear, timely, and proactive communication.                |
| **Problem Solver** | Effectively handle unexpected issues and complexities.     |

### The Compensation Conversation

The data suggests that a significant number of consumers are now more open to discussing agent compensation.

* **74%** of all respondents in this new survey transaction noted that they **entered into an agreement** during a time when they believed agents are overpaid.
* **33%** of respondents who would agree to pay a buyer agent view the services of a buyer agent as being **free**.
* **21%** of respondents would pay a buyer agent a fair compensation.

We think there's a silver lining here. We believe that a skilled agent, possessed of a clear message explaining the potential complexities or unexpected challenges that effectively aligns their value with consumer expectations, should cause buyers to make supports the case for buyer agent compensation.

"If people now understand that they are paying for the service of buyer representation, they are likely to become more diligent in choosing an agent."

This underscores our belief that **communicating your value** on the buyer's side should not be a one-time effort at the settlement, but rather a sustained and methodical practice.

## Challenges and Opportunities

The shift in the market presents both challenges and opportunities for real estate professionals.

### The Challenge of Perception

When we asked, "What did you think your real estate agent’s job was in your home purchase transaction?", the top answer, by a significant margin, was: **To negotiate with sellers and their agents.**

This perception, while not entirely wrong, is less about the process of closing and more about the contents and the questions the buyer has. This disclosure is critically important to review in detail.

### The Opportunity for Value Alignment

We believe that agents who can clearly articulate their value beyond just negotiation will be better positioned for success.

* **Finding a real estate agent:** This was less of a problem for buyers than for the sellers we surveyed. But we think this will shift in light of the settlement changes.
* **Communication with sellers and their agents:** The last-minute rush to settlement and the lack of communication from sellers and their agents is a common stress point.

By proactively addressing these stress points and demonstrating value in areas like **financial literacy**, **contract complexity**, and **post-settlement support**, agents can create a significant and measurable financial benefit for their clients.

## Conclusion

The new reality is here. It is a market that rewards clarity, competence, and a clear articulation of value. Agents who embrace this change and focus on aligning their services with the high expectations of today's buyers will not only thrive but will also help elevate the entire profession.

The key takeaway is that the market is ripe for an opportunity to position a highly capable service professional or company to enter a field where 70% of all customers didn't feel they received value for their money. Indeed, it is.
