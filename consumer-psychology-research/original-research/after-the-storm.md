## Executive Summary

The real estate market is presenting a **challenging and intriguing crossroads** for consumers. This research, based on interviews with over 1,000 consumers, reveals a striking vulnerability and a strategic opportunity.

* **Vulnerability:** 81% of sellers selected an agent for their largest transaction _without_ interviewing an alternative. This blind spot represents both a market vulnerability and a strategic opportunity.
* **Risk Perception:** 85% of buyers fear hidden property problems, yet only 9% worry about choosing the wrong agent. Similarly, 86% of sellers fear a low sales price, but only 11% worry about choosing the wrong agent. This highlights a disconnect between consumers' primary financial concerns and their agent selection process.
* **The Missing Link:** The data suggests a critical gap between the value delivered by skilled agents and consumers' perception of that value. Common advertising themes (e.g., "local expert," "trusted advisor") are failing to resonate.
* **Generational Divide:**
  * **Gen Z** and **Young Millennials** emerge as the strongest believers in agent value.
  * **Boomers** and **Gen X** are more cautious and discerning, demanding more care and distinction.
* **The Critical Question:** 41% of homeowners across all generations question whether agent fees are worth the investment, signaling a critical gap between value delivered and perceived value.

This report begins to answer these questions and aims to bridge the gap between value delivery and perception.

## Buyer Concerns: The Fear of the Unknown

The greatest fear for home buyers is **uncovering hidden property problems** once the deal is closed. This fear aligns with our comprehensive research on the buyer's-side value proposition.

| Buyer Fear                               | Percentage of Home Buyers |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Uncovering hidden problems after closing | 85%                       |
| Overpaying                               | 79%                       |
| Not finding the right home               | 78%                       |
| Mortgage rate increases                  | 73%                       |
| Choosing the wrong agent                 | 9%                        |

{% hint style="info" %}
Key Finding: The focus on property risk overshadows the risk of poor agent selection. Buyers often want guidance in avoiding costly mistakes, even if they don't explicitly cite agent choice as a primary fear.

### Generational Nuances in Agent Selection

| Generation                                | Likelihood to Interview More Than One Agent    | Reason for Not Interviewing More Than One                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gen Z** & **Young Millennials** (25-34) | Most likely to interview more than one person. | Trust, recommendations, or convenience.                         |
| **Boomers** (60+)                         | 88% did not interview more than one person.    | Defaulting to a familiar face instead of a vetted professional. |
| **Gen X** (45-59)                         | 81% did not interview more than one person.    | Nearly as likely as Boomers to skip the interview process.      |

Conclusion: The default comfort of a familiar face often trumps the need for competence. This "convenience bias" creates an opening for skilled agents who can demonstrate their expertise.

## Seller Fears: Price & Time Matter, Agent Selection Less So

Sellers are acutely aware of pricing and timing risks, but they often miss the connection between these concerns and agent expertise.

| Seller Fear                             | Percentage of Homeowners |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Not getting enough money for their home | 86%                      |
| Home sitting on the market too long     | 82%                      |
| Hiring a bad real estate agent          | 11%                      |

The Missing Link: Replacing generic experience claims with **evidence-backed expertise** is the key. This transforms an agent from 'just another agent' into what sellers truly value: a data-backed advisor who drives real financial results.

### Agent Usage: Moderately Below National Average

While the vast majority of homeowners (**87%**) used a real estate agent when buying or selling their home, our research found that **13% did not**—a rate that exceeds the national For Sale By Owner (FSBO) average of 6% \[1].

Demographics of Agent Usage:

* **Gender:** Women (57%) were more likely than men (43%) to use an agent, yet they also made up 67% of those who did not hire one.
* **Income:** Mid-tier earners ($100K-$124K at 11% and $125K-$149K at 9%) showed the highest agent utilization.

## The Value Gap: Are Agent Fees Worth It?

The single most critical finding for the industry is the question of value. **41% of homeowners across all generations question whether agent fees are worth the investment.**

This is a critical gap between value delivered and perceived value. The industry must proactively address this concern.

### The Impact of Advertising Themes on Consumer Perception

We tested five different advertising themes to see which resonated most with consumers.

| Ad Theme                  | Description                                                                  | Most Effective with           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Ad 1: "Experience Ad"** | Focuses on years of experience, local knowledge, and number of transactions. | **Boomers** (60+)             |
| **Ad 2: "Process Ad"**    | Focuses on a clear, step-by-step process for buying or selling.              | **Gen X** (45-59)             |
| **Ad 3: "Immediacy Ad"**  | Focuses on speed and quick results.                                          | **Young Millennials** (25-34) |
| **Ad 4: "Revelation Ad"** | Focuses on uncovering hidden risks and protecting the consumer.              | **Elder Millennials** (35-44) |
| **Ad 5: "Realism Ad"**    | Focuses on a data-driven, no-nonsense approach to the market.                | **Gen Z** (18-24)             |

Key Takeaway: No single message works for everyone. The industry needs to segment its messaging to address the specific concerns and values of different generations. The "Experience Ad," the industry's most common theme, is only effective with the oldest demographic.

## Conclusion

The post-settlement world presents a moment of truth for the real estate industry. Consumers are more vulnerable to poor agent selection than they realize, and a significant portion is questioning the value proposition of the agent fee.

The path forward is clear: **replace generic claims with evidence-backed expertise.** Agents must evolve from being "just another agent" to becoming a **data-backed advisor** who can articulate and demonstrate their financial value to the client.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Industry implication: Demonstrable, evidence-backed messaging tailored to generational preferences will be essential to close the perceived value gap and defend agent relevance.
