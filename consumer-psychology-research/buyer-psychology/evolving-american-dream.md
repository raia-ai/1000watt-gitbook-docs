## How Young Adults View Homeownership

**Original Research**\
&#xNAN;_&#x4D;arch 2025_

***

## Introduction

The homeownership story is evolving. A new generation approaches property ownership with different priorities and expectations than their predecessors.

Demand persists. But for different reasons. Homeownership isn't primarily financial anymore. It's about identity and control in uncertain times.

As the industry navigates internal challenges, a new generation of buyers is questioning a deeper premise: Is buying a home still the right move? Can I trust my agent to mitigate risk?

* 11% prioritize building equity

### Freedom Beats Finance

## Market Context

Millennials represent 38% of all homebuyers (NAR, 2024¹). Their mindset isn't just a market shift—it's the future.

Professionals who understand and act on these changing attitudes will earn trust and business. Those who do not will struggle to gain share with this cohort.

## Financial Hurdles Dominate the Homeownership Challenge

Affordability isn't just a homebuying problem. It starts with rent. Rent consumes what could be down payment savings. Half of renters spend 30%+ of income on housing (U.S. Census Bureau, 2024²), making homebuying a perpetually distant goal for many.

Top financial barriers named:

* Down payments (33%)
* Monthly costs (29%)
* Economic and world uncertainty (22%)

Perceived uncertainty in today's global economic climate exceeds 2021 findings. Forward-thinking players may use this moment to recalibrate customer acquisition strategies, moving to stability narratives that address emotional roadblocks qualified buyers face.

### These Barriers Don't Hit All Buyers Equally

* Credit concerns: parents worry at twice the rate of non-parents (21% vs. 11%)
* Income gap: lower-income buyers (<$50K) express credit anxiety three times more than higher-income buyers ($150K+) — 18% vs. 6%
* Education: higher-educated buyers cite "economic and world uncertainty" more frequently (24% vs. 17%)

{% hint style="info" %}
What this means:

* Talk to different buyers differently. Affordability concerns vary by life stage and demographic.
* Lead with financial expertise, not listings. Buyers need solutions and clarity, not reminders of cost.
{% endhint %}

## Freedom Over Capital: The Modern Homebuying Motivation

Money blocks the path to ownership, but it isn't the primary driver.

Among aspiring homeowners:

* 36%: "I want my own place that I can change how I want"
* 11%: prioritize wealth-building
* 10%: concerned about rising housing costs

This desire for autonomy is stronger among non-parents (39%) and lower-educated buyers (42%). For many, a home is an extension of identity — personal sovereignty and self-expression.

Cultural pressures remain influential:

* "Owning is always better than renting" (35%)
* Age-related milestones (27%)

{% hint style="info" %}
What this means:

* Sell the personal desire, not just the math. Emphasize autonomy and lifestyle.
* Segment by motivation, not just demographics. Non-parents crave autonomy; parents need stability; older Millennials feel timeline pressure.
{% endhint %}

***

## Risk Perception and Decision Making

* 75% of potential homebuyers view homeownership as risky across all income levels, yet most intend to proceed.

{% hint style="warning" %}
What this means:

* Retire the "stretch your budget" pitch. Buyers want to know if they should buy, not only if they can.
* Target risk messaging by segment: wealth preservation for higher-income buyers; catastrophic-mistake avoidance for lower-income buyers.
* Become a financial security advisor: agents who help clients navigate uncertainty will win trust.
{% endhint %}

## Social Media and Digital Engagement

82% don't follow real estate agents on social media — only 18% do. This is down substantially from April 2023's 41% follow rate.

The decline likely stems from content fatigue, templated/AI-driven posts, and shifts in platform usage from discovery to entertainment. Consumers are more selective about where they maintain relationships with agents.

### The 18% Who Do Follow Reveal What Works

They follow for:

* Dreams (46%)
* Personal connections (34%)
* Market insights (18%)

{% hint style="info" %}
What this means:

* Make them want it: high-production tours, before-and-after transformations, and neighborhood stories build desire.
* Play the long game: build relationships with authentic, behind-the-scenes content.
* Make market insights matter: avoid dry charts; explain why market moves matter and how they affect decisions.
{% endhint %}

## Conclusion

The homeownership landscape is shifting. Young adults prioritize control, identity, and personal freedom over traditional wealth-building motivations.

Financial barriers remain significant, but underlying drivers have evolved. Success requires:

* Understanding new motivations
* Adapting strategies to address emotional and financial concerns
* Building genuine relationships and providing financial expertise

Agents who navigate uncertainty, offer clear financial guidance, and build long-term trust will succeed. Those who cling to outdated approaches will struggle to connect with the future of the housing market.
