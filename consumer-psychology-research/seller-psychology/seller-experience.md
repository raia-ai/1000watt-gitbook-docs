## Intro

There has been much focus on buyers lately, understandably. But the seller experience has also changed, and they too are now called to think more closely about what agents do, and what they are paid for doing it.

Smart brokers, agents, teams – and those who serve them – would do well to revisit sellers' needs holistically in this moment, and meet them in new ways.

Toward that end, we tapped into seller sentiment nationwide.

We first wanted to check in on awareness of the changes that took effect in August, and how people perceive agents and their value. We break out the results on these questions by age cohort and gender. This is something we have monitored consistently since last year's Sitzer verdict.

We then move to how peoples' selling experience compared to their expectations, what they found most difficult about that experience, and what they believed they hired their agent to do.

We also sussed out how much difference there is between sellers "liking" or "loving" their agent, and perceptions of value.

Several questions in our survey were open-ended, with responses collected via an open-text field. We then used ChatGPT to perform a sentiment analysis of all responses for each question, which we then had it summarize. In this way, we can provide you with insights from open-ended responses that leverage the full scale of our survey.

We highlight our high-level takeaways below but hope you also find your own.

As usual, a live Members-only webinar will follow up on this report, as will Actionable Marketing based on its insights.

## About our survey and sample

We surveyed 1,000 adults across the country who had recently been involved in a transaction. 650 of them had sold a home. Our results for questions focused on awareness of industry changes reflect all 1,000 respondents; those focused on selling issues represent responses from our 650 sellers.

We screened out the following:

* People working in the real estate or mortgage industries.
* People with a partner or spouse working in the real estate or mortgage industries.
* Active real estate investors

## Key findings

### Agent compensation sentiment

Awareness of recent changes to industry practices continued to increase. More respondents (56%) now believe real estate agents are paid too much than at any point in our three years of surveys. This is not surprising given media coverage over the past year but nonetheless underscores the degree to which value must now be explained and delivered more convincingly.

More affluent respondents were far more aware of changes brought about by the NAR lawsuit settlement. 35–44-year-olds ("elder millennials") are the most aware group across generational cohorts, with just 22% reporting no awareness.

More affluent respondents and those 54+ (older Gen X and Boomers) were more likely to believe agents are overpaid.

### Seller experience

33% of sellers found the process to be "more complicated" than expected. This suggests that a fuller explanation of the transaction journey at the beginning of the process is warranted.

When asked to identify the most difficult part of their home sale experience, the top responses were presented below as steps describing the top difficulties.

### Getting the home ready to sell

28% cited prepping their home for sale (cleaning, painting, staging, etc.) as the most difficult part.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Finding a real estate agent they could trust

23% cited finding a real estate agent they could trust as the most difficult part.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Dealing with disclosures, reports, and paperwork

19% cited dealing with disclosures, reports, and paperwork as the most difficult part.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

These responses are perhaps not surprising, but there were stark and unexpected differences along gender and age lines.

Men are far more likely to find finding an agent they can trust difficult. In fact, this was their #1 cited difficulty (27%). Few women found this difficult, though. Only 11% cited finding an agent they could trust as the most difficult part of their selling process.

The divide was also sharp along age lines, with nearly 30% of Gen Z and Millennial sellers citing this issue most difficult, while only 9% of Elder Gen X and Boomer sellers found finding a trustworthy agent difficult. It is reasonable to surmise that these younger consumers are more likely to gravitate to non-traditional or "fresh" messaging from real estate brokers and agents.

Sellers viewed "Negotiating with buyers and their agents" as their agent's #1 job. This is followed closely by "Advertising and marketing my property". Only those 54+ placed marketing above all else. We think there is an opportunity here for practitioners and companies that can explain to potential sellers what stands to be gained from skilled negotiation (and what stands to be lost in its absence).

Young sellers are almost twice as likely to negotiate fees than are older cohorts. 38% of all respondents who have sold a home negotiated a fee lower than that initially offered by their agent, but 59% of sellers aged 25-34 did so. The percentage of sellers who negotiate goes down all the way up the generational ladder.

Feeling good about one's agent does not necessarily translate into valuing one's agent. Industry observers have long puzzled over the fact that while post-transaction surveys have consistently shown that consumers are happy with their agent, yet often do not use their agent again. Our results suggest an answer. While 71% of all respondents "liked" or "loved" their agent, and 75% felt that their agent was worth the money they paid them, 25% answered "not really" or "definitely not" when asked if what they got from their agent was worth what they paid for it.

Most notably, 12% of respondents who responded that they liked or loved their agent felt what they did was not worth what they paid.

## Sentiment analysis / summary of open-ended questions

<details>

<summary>How would you describe what changes (to how real estate agents work with homebuyers) will do?</summary>

**Concern Over Rising Costs and Financial Burden:**

* "It puts more pressure on home buyers to pay for additional costs."
* "I believe it will either cost sellers more of the sale price of their home or buyers will be out of even more money to purchase a home which will make it even harder to purchase a home."
* "This will significantly increase the cost of housing."

**Positive Outlook on Increased Transparency and Flexibility:**

* "It will help homebuyers save a great deal."
* "Changes will make commissions more transparent."
* "Sellers can now negotiate their commission rate instead of the industry having a designated rate."

**Skepticism About Market Stability and Negative Impact:**

* "These changes are very worrisome and extremely alarming."
* "Changes might cause the housing market to crash due to all these new changes implemented."
* "Make buying a house more complicated."

**Mixed Opinions on How Changes Affect Real Estate Agents:**

* "They will compensate sellers less."
* "The changes will hurt realtors and their income."
* "They can actually benefit real estate agents if used properly."

**Shift Toward Buyer and Seller Empowerment:**

* "Sellers and agents must negotiate compensation."
* "Clients and agents must pre-determine what the real estate agent will be paid."

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why do you think real estate agents are paid too much?</summary>

**Perception of Limited Effort for High Pay:**

* "Most of the time they do not do more than a couple of hours work to sell properties and that's a little bit of time spent to make a lot of money."
* "They basically file paperwork on our behalf, then take thousands of dollars from us, so yes, way overpaid, and it's why people list themselves and just pay a lawyer."
* "Because what really do they do. Try to match who would like what house. Complete guessing game."

**Feeling That Commissions Are Disproportionate:**

* "6% commission results in high payments. $30,000 on a $500,000 home."
* "With the current prices on housing, even a 3% fee can mean $15k and up on average homes... an absurd amount of money for the time and work involved."
* "For the amount of time they invest into selling a house, the commission they get is exorbitant."

**Criticism of Agents' Contribution to the Process:**

* "They don't do anything to earn the amount they charge."
* "The homes can sell themselves if they are presented well."
* "Sometimes the real estate agent just has to sit back and wait for someone to be interested and hand over their money."

**Impact of Technological Advancements:**

* "The process has become much easier with the inventions of new technologies so their role has diminished."
* "Much can be done online."
* "Clients do most of the work in finding their home from online searches. Real estate agents just do paperwork, which clients can do or pay an attorney to do."

**Belief That Commission Structures Are Outdated:**

* "I think the rates should be graduated as the price of the home being sold gets more expensive."
* "6 or 7 per cent commissions are too high for the work they do. Flat rate sales amount should be more what they should be paid."
* "Percent of sale is usually high and should be a flat fee."

</details>

<details>

<summary>If you could improve one thing about the process of selling a home, what would it be?</summary>

**Paperwork Reduction:**

* "Less paperwork"
* "Make the paperwork easier"
* "Less paperwork involved"

**Fee and Cost Management:**

* "Eliminate closing costs"
* "Cheaper real estate agent rates"
* "Reduce real estate agent fees"

**Agent Performance and Involvement:**

* "The agent and selling price"
* "Having the real estate company help more with the paperwork"
* "Hire a different realtor - she did almost nothing"

**Process Simplification and Transparency:**

* "Make it simpler"
* "More transparency about the buying and selling process"
* "Simplify the closing procedure"

**Communication and Efficiency:**

* "Communication"
* "Time efficient and easy communication"
* "Faster process"

**Advertising and Marketing (continued):**

* "Marketing my home to a greater area"
* "The amount of advertising that goes into marketing your home"

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why did you feel like you didn't get your money's worth (from the agent selling your home)?</summary>

**High Commissions vs. Minimal Effort:**

* "The real estate agent basically did very little work... The open house that I sponsored was the catalyst for what actually sold my home."
* "The fee was too high for the amount of work that went into selling my home."
* "I feel like I could have sold my home without a real estate agent and saved a substantial amount."

**Perceived Lack of Effort from Agents:**

* "My agent didn't seem that concerned about selling my home and didn't contact us after the sale."
* "She did not really do anything; the house sold in two days."
* "I felt like the agent was not active in showing my house so it took a lot longer than it should have."

**Belief That Agents Did Not Add Value:**

* "My house was very popular and would sell regardless of the agent."
* "The market was hot, and my house sold quickly with minimal marketing from the realtor."
* "I found the buyer myself; the agent did very little."

**Discontent with Communication and Professionalism:**

* "Poor communication. Didn't follow my wishes."
* "My agent was horrible. She wasn't proactive and did not address my concerns effectively."
* "She was arrogant and didn't listen, and I felt belittled throughout the process."
