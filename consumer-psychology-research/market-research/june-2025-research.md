# June 2025 research

**JUNE 2025 - ORIGINAL RESEARCH by 1000WATT MEMBERSHIP** _How to win more sellers by speaking to the feeling behind the experience_

## Introduction

We think you would agree that emotion looms large for most home sellers. We think you would also agree that the most effective marketing, messaging, and advertising employs emotion.

But for the most part, we think the emotion of a home sale, and home seller, is under-studied and under leveraged in marketing to prospective clients.

The emotional territory of buying, on the other hand, is well-trod. The “dream of homeownership”, the stress of competition, the joy of moving in. You know the notes.

This report seeks to explore the fears, strains and joys of human beings selling the place in which they live. This is becoming more salient by the day as inventory swells, demand flags, and the market balance tilts towards buyers.

What we found will help you approach today's market with greater insight and confidence.

In the following pages, you will learn:

* How recent sellers perceived their agent, and the role they played in supporting their sale
* What sellers fear most, how often fear is realized, and who or what they blame when that happens
* The points in the selling process where sellers feel the most anxiety
* How today's sellers think and feel about the home they are selling
* Which moments present opportunities to create emotional connection with sellers

We hope this spurs ideas for you, or within your brokerage or team. Of course, we have ideas of our own and will be sharing those soon.

## About our survey and samples

In early June we fielded a survey of **1,000 adults aged 24-99 across the U.S. who have sold a home in the past 5 years.** We screened out real estate agents, real estate investors, loan officers, and people involved in the residential real estate industry in any way.

## How sellers describe agents

### Advisor. Guide. Confidant. — Say It Like They See It

**87% of sellers described their agent as an Advisor, Guide, or Confidant.**

Sellers remember how their agent made them feel. It's about being trusted when it matters.

Younger sellers (24-34) leaned into strategy: 60% called their agent an Advisor.

Older sellers (65+) wanted reassurance: 45% said Advisor, but 26% chose Guide.

Mid-career sellers made up the bulk of these responses. And 57% were parents. These aren't first-timers. They're navigating work, family, and a major transition. They don't want a salesperson. They want a trusted partner. A compass through the chaos.

Some patterns stood out:

* High earners were more likely to call their agent an Advisor (66% at $200K vs. 50% at $10K).
* Older sellers (60+) were 4x more likely to call their agent a Disappointment (9% vs. 2% under 40), though a small minority.

According to Edelman's 2024 Trust Barometer, 78% of people build trust during vulnerable moments¹. Selling a home is one of them. In these high-stakes situations, presence, clarity, and timing shape how your value is perceived. Expertise may open the door, but trust is earned by showing up with empathy and consistency when emotions run high.

{% hint style="info" %}
WHAT TO DO

* Use the words they already believe. Sellers see agents as Advisors, Guides, or Confidants. That's your positioning. Own it. Agent is the job. Advisor is the value. Lead with that.
* Speak to the emotionally maxed-out. When life is full and decisions are heavy, they need a message that reassures, not overwhelms.
* Coach for memory-shaping moments. Presence matters. Train agents to show up in the flashpoints with empathy and authority — showings, feedback, negotiations, letting go. That's what sellers remember.
{% endhint %}

> Agent is the job. Advisor is the value.

## Stress in choosing an agent

### People are stressed about choosing an agent (and you can de-stress them)

One in three sellers found choosing an agent to sell their home a stressful process. But younger sellers (44% of those 24-34) felt it most. Just 17% of those 65+ said the same.

The top reason? 47% said: “I wasn't really sure what to look for in an agent.”

Uncertainty was highest among Bachelor's degree holders (38%) and those earning $100K-$125K (15%).

Another 29% said all agents seemed the same — a clear sign that differentiation is failing, especially for sellers in their 30s.

The problem isn't finding agents. It's telling them apart. Help people do that and you'll address a significant pain point.

According to NAR (2024)², 75% hire the first agent they meet. Our February 2025 data confirms it: just 33% interviewed more than one agent.

In a sea of sameness, differentiation is everything.

When sellers feel unsure, it's not their failure, it's the industry's. We haven't done enough to market what makes a great agent. That's the opportunity: define it yourself—and lead with it.

{% hint style="info" %}
WHAT TO DO

* Define your difference in outcomes. Don't say you're experienced. Show how that experience affects pricing, timing, and peace of mind.
* Productize your process. Turn your playbook into something sellers can name and choose. A great agent isn't just responsive, they lead with a proven plan.
* Own the evaluation moment. Teach sellers how to compare. Show them what expertise looks like, sounds like, and delivers — so they know when they've found it.
{% endhint %}

> In a sea of sameness, differentiation is everything.

### Why did you find choosing a real estate agent to be stressful?

_(Represents 33% of respondents who found the process of choosing a real estate agent stressful)_

* **I wasn't really sure what to look for in an agent:** 47%
* **All real estate agents seem the same to me:** 29%
* **I don't like dealing with salespeople:** 20%
* **Other:** 4%

## Pricing and trust dynamics

### Sellers Trust Agent Pricing — Until the Price Misses

Pricing is the emotional fulcrum of the seller experience. Over half of sellers trusted their agent to set the right number (56%), far more than trusted themselves (24%) or online tools (18%). But trust isn't automatic. It drops among younger sellers (45% among 24-34 vs. 68% for 65+), and it breaks when the result disappoints.

Still, most sellers walked away satisfied: 50% said the final price met expectations, and 28% said it exceeded them. But among the 22% who were disappointed, 28% blamed their agent's pricing strategy—equal to those who blamed the market itself.

Confidence gaps widened by demographic: Men were nearly twice as likely as women to trust their own pricing instincts (30% vs. 16%), while women deferred to their agent more often (60%). Higher-income sellers ($200K+) were twice as likely to feel let down (24% vs. 12% at $75K-$99K). Higher-educated sellers were also more anxious—26% named pricing as their top fear. And when blame lands, it often lands on the agent—especially among men (67% of those who blamed their agent were male).

Pricing is where confidence is built or broken. If it misses, you own it, or the market does. Either way, you're in the story.

{% hint style="info" %}
WHAT TO DO

* Own the pricing narrative early. Don't wait for doubts, preempt them. Walk sellers through pricing scenarios from the start. Show how your strategy flexes with the market. Logic now prevents blame later.
* Systematize your pricing. Turn process into confidence. Use structure, language, and proof. A methodical, data-backed approach builds trust—especially with skeptics and high-expectation clients.
* Speak to fear, not around it. Surface concerns early. Lead with data, but don't stop there. Make the conversation thorough, honest, and forward-looking, so sellers know what happens if things shift.
{% endhint %}

> Pricing is where confidence is built or broken.

### The last time you sold a home, how did you feel about the final selling price relative to your initial expectations?

* **Met my expectations:** 50%
* **Somewhat exceeded my expectations:** 20%
* **Somewhat below my expectations:** 17%
* **Far exceeded my expectations:** 8%
* **Far below my expectations:** 5%

## Lifestyle vs. logistics

### Sellers Are Prioritizing Lifestyle Over Logistics

29% of sellers moved for space. 24% moved for lifestyle. Only 13% moved for a job. They weren't pushed. They chose. This was about alignment.

Over half saw their home as a “private sanctuary" (31%) or "an extension of self" (26%). That held across age, income, and education. It wasn't about status. It was about identity.

This echoes our April 2025 findings: the top reason aspiring buyers want to own a home? “I want my own place that I can change how I want." That beat out wealth-building and even rising housing costs.

From buyers to sellers, it's the same story. This isn't about where they live. It's about who they are — aligning with the life they want next.

{% hint style="info" %}
WHAT TO DO

* Lead with lifestyle. Market the life a home enables beyond the features it contains. Freedom, flow, connection—these are the drivers buyers care about.
* Make emotion your advantage. Sellers are telling you what matters: more space, less space, a different rhythm. These aren't just data points, they're direction. Use them to shape how you message, market, and show up.
* Rebuild your seller personas. Segment by mindset, not just demographics. Values and intent offer more insight than age or income ever will.
{% endhint %}

> These aren't just data points, they're direction.

### Which of the following best describes how you feel about the home you live in/lived in?

* **It's my private sanctuary from the stresses of the world:** 31%
* **It's an extension of myself and my personality – part of who I am:** 26%
* **It's an investment in my/my family's financial future:** 16%
* **It's just a house - a place to live:** 14%
* **It's a source of pride:** 13%
* **Other:** 1%

## What sellers fear most

### Their Biggest Fear? Only 1 in 10 Say It Happened

Sellers walk in expecting disaster. Most never face it.

Their top fears:

* 25%: Not getting the price they wanted
* 22%: Slow sale
* 18%: Last-minute collapse
* 16%: Inspection issues
* 9%: Not finding a new home in time

And these fears came from people who sold in the last five years, when the market was on their side. If confidence wavers even then, what happens when it's not? That makes a proactive pricing conversation not just helpful—but essential.

The irony? Most of what sellers fear never happens. Only 10% said their greatest fear came true completely. Another 21% said it happened partially. The majority (69%) said it didn't happen at all or only came close.

{% hint style="info" %}
WHAT TO DO

* Make fear your strategic positioning. Even if the worst rarely happens, sellers still brace for it. Step in early with clarity and conviction. Get ahead of the pricing conversation, and bring a plan to what feels uncertain.
* Speak to real emotion. Skip the generic. Use the top fears—including pricing—to shape your marketing, training, and conversations.
* Train agents to name and neutralize fear. Equip agents to name and disarm fears early before they become objections. A clear plan calms uncertainty before it turns into doubt.
{% endhint %}

> Most of what sellers fear never happens.

### What was your greatest fear during the selling process?

* **Not getting the price I wanted:** 25%
* **The home would take too long to sell:** 23%
* **Deal falling through at the last minute:** 18%
* **Major issues discovered during inspection:** 16%
* **Not finding a new place in time:** 9%
* **Regretting the decision to sell:** 8%
* **Other:** 1%

## Moments of opportunity on move day

### Move day is big opportunity — But most agents miss it

Move day is the emotional finale. Only 44% of sellers said move day went as expected. 35% found it harder than they anticipated. Stress peaks when the stakes feel final.

Most agents were MIA. Only 39% showed up. But when they did, 83% of sellers remembered it positively. Only 1% wished they hadn't.

In our 2024 seller survey, 33% said the entire process was more complicated than expected—a reminder that the breakdown often starts long before the boxes.

Move day is a loyalty moment. It's where trust can become advocacy — if you show up.

Support in the chaos becomes the story they tell.

{% hint style="info" %}
WHAT TO DO

* Turn presence into positioning. Don't just offer support. Own it. Position “we show up when it's hard" as a defining brand promise. Make move-day presence your standard.
* Target the tension. Parents, solo movers, and first-timers carry more of the load. Speak directly to their stress with tailored prep, check-ins, and real-time reassurance.
* Use move-day stories as proof. Don't wait for the testimonial. Build trust early with real examples of move-day support. Show how your team shows up when others don't.
{% endhint %}

> Move day is a loyalty moment.

### How did the reality of moving day compare to your expectations?

* **Exactly as expected:** 44%
* **Somewhat more difficult than expected:** 26%
* **Somewhat easier than expected:** 14%
* **Much more difficult than expected:** 10%
* **Much easier than expected:** 6%

## Surprising sources of stress

### Unexpected stress is the worst kind of stress

Emotions don't follow the sale — they lead it. Sellers feel exposed. Emotionally. Personally. Reputationally.

Nearly 1 in 5 sellers felt unprepared for negotiation pressure. Another 19% weren't ready for inspection anxiety - high-stakes, high-emotion moments that shake seller confidence. 16% struggled to balance logic and emotion. And 14% wanted help with something as basic as saying goodbye.

Our 2024 data highlighted tactical stress - paperwork and prep. This time? It's emotional overload.

And then came the neighbors. Among the 73% who felt discomfort at showings, top triggers were exposure of private spaces (17%), buyer comments (14%), fear of criticism (12%), and post-showing gossip (11%). These amplify a seller's vulnerability at a critical moment.

Despite all this, 67% didn't use professional staging. Even among $150K+ earners, 60% skipped it. Women were 8 points more likely to stage than men. Staging helps sellers detach emotionally and see their home as a product, not a reflection of self.

{% hint style="info" %}
WHAT TO DO

* Lead with emotional fluency. Make emotional intelligence part of your brand promise. Show how your team handles stress, feedback, and uncertainty. Sellers shouldn't carry the weight of the hardest moments on their own. Let them know: it's coming, it might feel heavy, but this is where you show up strongest. This is why you're here.
* Recast staging as strategic detachment. Sell it as a mindset shift, not a to-do list. Help sellers move from homeowner to marketer, and take some of the emotion out of the process.
* Pre-frame the emotional friction. Call out goodbye grief, awkward neighbor moments, and that sense of vulnerability—before it surfaces. When you name it early, you lead the story, not just react to it.
{% endhint %}

> It's emotional overload.

### Which emotional aspect of selling do you wish your agent had better prepared you for?

_(Represents 93% of respondents who used a real estate agent the last time they sold a home)_

* **Negotiation stress:** 20%
* **Inspection anxiety:** 19%
* **Balancing practical and emotional decisions:** 16%
* **Saying goodbye:** 14%
* **Other:** 9%
* **Depersonalizing your space:** 8%
* **Processing negative feedback:** 8%
* **Post-sale emotions:** 7%

## Navigating the goodbye

### Sellers Grieve the Goodbye — Not the Judgment

Critique didn't hurt. Separation did.

* Over 60% weren't fazed by seeing their home online or the For Sale sign.
* 60% handled criticism of their home well.
* But 64% struggled with leaving memories behind.
* 53% found driving away hard.

Lower-income sellers felt it most (51% of those under $50K). Younger sellers (under 35) and mothers under 45 felt the emotional strain more than others.

And for half of sellers, discomfort came from having strangers in their space. That unease helped alternative models like iBuyers gain traction: they offered distance. But you can meet that same need, with more trust and better results.

Here's the blind spot: Sellers fear detachment—and intrusion—not judgment. They're mourning their connection and guarding their space.

{% hint style="info" %}
WHAT TO DO

* Offer control and care. Use your listing presentation to show exactly how you'll manage showings, open houses, and access, so sellers stay in control and their routines stay intact. Let them know: they don't need to be there. You've got it covered.
* Make emotional transition a differentiator. Most handle the sale. Few handle the goodbye. Guide sellers through the emotional side because how they leave matters just as much as where they're going.
* Train for separation. Equip agents to navigate the emotional weight of letting go. Build a brand that honors what sellers are leaving behind— not just what's next.

## Sentiment analysis of open-ended questions

We included two open-ended questions where respondents could share unfiltered thoughts. The responses provided qualitative insights beyond structured data. We used a custom GPT to analyze and outline the most illustrative response themes.

### Helpful and Responsive — 58%

## Conclusion

Insight is nothing without action.

Sellers were clear: They want less talk, more guidance.\
Less flash, more follow-through.\
They don't need to be impressed. They need to feel fully supported.

That's your opportunity. To make your process visible. To prove your value before they ever ask.

Because when trust starts early, the whole experience changes. When emotion is acknowledged, loyalty sticks. And when your message matches what sellers actually feel, it works.

Emotion is the signal. Clarity is the ask. Presence is the win.

That's the roadmap.
