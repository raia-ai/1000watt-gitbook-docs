short\_description: "An original research report by 1000WATT from October 2024, analyzing buyer expectations in the real estate market following recent legal settlements.

long\_description: "This October 2024 report by 1000WATT Membership, titled 'Buyer Expectations Post-Settlement,' presents original research on the shifting landscape of consumer expectations in real estate. The report's primary focus is on understanding what home buyers expect from their agents in the 'value era' following major industry legal settlements. It is based on a survey of 1,000 adults who purchased a home in the past five years, excluding industry insiders. The report's key findings indicate a growing perception that agents are overpaid (57% of all respondents, 63% of those aware of the settlement). However, it also presents some data that appears to be from sellers or a mixed sample of transactors, asking about the complexity of the 'selling process' and the agent's role in a 'home sale transaction.' Despite this potential ambiguity in the presented data, the core analysis centers on buyer pain points, identifying home searching, paperwork, and negotiation as critical opportunities for agents to prove their worth. The research argues that buyers want a 'fierce negotiator' and that simple affinity for an agent is no longer enough to justify their fee. The document concludes with a sentiment analysis from buyers who felt they did not receive their money's worth, highlighting themes of perceived lack of effort, high fees, poor communication, and mismatched expectations. The report aims to provide real estate professionals with a clear picture of how to align their services with new consumer demands."\

## Buyer Expectations Post-Settlement

**OCTOBER 2024**

_The opportunities in a new reality_

**1000WATT MEMBERSHIP - ORIGINAL RESEARCH**

### Introduction

Buyers have internalized a new real estate reality. At this point, 70% of consumers in our surveys have at least heard of the legal settlement terms. Those who have not are quickly brought up to speed when they enter transaction mode.

What we need to know, now, is this: What do buyers expect from their agent, and the real estate transaction process as a whole, in this new era?

Our own qualitative data - gleaned from numerous conversations with clients, friends, and members - leads us to believe that competent agents are handling the new rules of engagement with buyers reasonably well. Nonetheless, aligning service delivery with consumer expectations is a much higher stakes proposition than it used to be.

As we noted last month in our report on sellers, we have clearly entered the value era. Where personal affinity drove many agent/client relationships in the past - knowing, liking, or “loving” one's agent - consumers are now much more inclined to assess an agent on value delivered. Good agents can thrive in such an environment — provided they have a clear picture of how consumers evaluate that value.

This report is a first step in creating that clarity.

### About our survey and sample

We surveyed 1,000 adults across the country who had purchased a home in the past five years.

We screened out the following:

* People working in the real estate or mortgage industries
* People with a partner or spouse working in the real estate or mortgage industries
* Active real estate investors

### Key findings

**Buyers are more inclined to think agents are overpaid now than at any point in the recent past, especially those who claim knowledge of the settlement.**

Over the past two years, the percentage of recent buyers who believe agents are overpaid has hovered between 40-45%. That percentage is now significantly higher. 57% of all respondents in this new survey now believe agents are overpaid, and 63% of respondents who claim to know a lot, or at least some, about the settlement terms, take this view.

This may seem discouraging. We see it differently. The fact that 40% of respondents - people who have been inundated with anti-realtor messages over the past year - believe agents are paid fairly is remarkable. We believe that a skilled agent, possessed of a message that effectively aligns their value with consumer expectations, should have no problem getting paid fairly going forward.

**Too many buyers are unpleasantly surprised by the transaction experience — which presents an opportunity**

In last month's report on sellers, we found that 33% found the selling process to be “more complicated than expected.” 29% of our buyers felt the same way. Note that the large majority of these buyers transacted before the settlement went into effect, during a time when many consumers viewed the services of a buyer agent as being free.

While this response is certainly not good, we think there's a silver lining. The conversations between buyers and agents mandated by the settlement present an opportunity to align expectations about not just compensation, but the totality of the buying process. In fact, explaining the potential complexities or unexpected challenges buyers may face supports the case for buyer agent compensation.

#### Buyers tell us very clearly where they need the most help

Our question "What did you find to be the most difficult part of your home purchase transaction" produced responses that literally outline what a good buyer presentation should cover. Here are the top five challenges, with our interpretation of each in italics:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Home search / finding a home

_We think this is not about home search functionality, which we have repeatedly found is viewed as table stakes by consumers, but rather an artifact of the low-inventory/high price market our respondents experienced._
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### The paperwork

_We think this is less about the process of e-signing docs than it is about their contents, and the questions they provoke. Which disclosures are critically important to review in detail? How deeply did my agent explain the requirements and terms of a purchase offer?_
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Negotiating with sellers and their agents

_This pain point is a critical opportunity for a skilled practitioner to address both the emotional and financial benefit of good buyer representation. Our past research has shown that buyers have an almost visceral aversion to negotiating, and view it as deeply stressful. A good agent alleviates that stress, while also (possibly) producing a significant and measurable financial benefit to their client._
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Determining how much to offer on a home

_Despite consumers' infatuation with the Zestimate and other online value estimates, the truth is that they have no idea what to pay, how much is enough, and how much is too much. This is a stress point that begs for effective messaging from skilled buyer agents, their brokers and teams._
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Finding a real estate agent I liked/trusted

_This was less of a problem for buyers than for the sellers we surveyed. But we think this will shift in light of the settlement changes. If people now understand that they are paying for the service of buyer representation, they are likely to become more diligent in choosing an agent. This underscores our belief that “communicating your value” on the buy-side should not be a transitory effort as we move forward from the settlement, but rather a sustained and methodical practice._
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

#### Buyers want a fierce negotiator

It has been an article of faith that sellers want a hard-as-nails advocate to maximize the value of their home. It's a matter of dollars and cents. This sentiment has not been nearly as prevalent on the buy-side, where the financial calculation, perhaps blurred by the use of borrowed funds, has been less straightforward. Real estate pros have generally done little to change this.

But buyers want a hard-as-nails advocate, too. When we asked "What did you think your real estate agent's #1 job was in your home purchase transaction?", the top answer, by a significant margin, was "To negotiate with sellers and their agents".

Again, we think the settlement helps those who are prepared. If buyers are now aware that they are paying their agent, it becomes incumbent upon the agent to tie their fee to the specific outcomes of advocacy and negotiation.

#### "Liking" or "loving” one's agent isn't enough for buyers, either

In our report on sellers last month, we noted that a significant number of people who reported liking or loving their agent nonetheless felt like they did not get sufficient value from them. This holds true for buyers as well. 26% of all buyers responded either "not really” (21%) or "Not at all" (5%) when asked "Did you feel like what you got from the real estate agent you used to buy your home was worth the money you paid them?"

Sticking to our pattern of finding the upside in seemingly negative findings, consider how encouraging it would be for a highly capable service professional or company to enter a field where 25% of all customers didn't feel they received value for their money. It would be viewed as a market ripe for opportunity.

And indeed it is.

### Sentiment analysis / summary of open-ended questions

While most questions in our survey presented defined choices, one was an open-ended text field where respondents could respond in any way:

> Why did you feel like you didn't get your money's worth?\
> (asked to the 25% of respondents who felt they did not receive value from their buyer agent)

We used a custom GPT to analyze and outline the text responses. The results are revealing and are presented within.
