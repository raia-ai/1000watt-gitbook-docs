TURNING INSIGHTS INTO ACTION

## Reinventing the Obvious: The "Just Listed" Postcard

_October 2024_

***

## Introduction

Now is a time for questioning assumptions. As large change unfolds around us, the best practices of the past may no longer be reliable. The math of 1.5 million agents and 80,000 brokerages chasing < 4 million home sales produces a result that demands differentiation. As consumers internalize new rules, they develop new expectations.

Reinvention is wise, both strategically and tactically.

We are therefore introducing a new series as part of Actionable Marketing we're calling "Reinventing the Obvious". In each installment, we'll take a simple but important element of real estate marketing, branding, or communication and think about how it can be made meaningfully more impactful. We start by asking the following questions:

* How can this serve to create difference in a crowded marketplace?
* How can this demonstrate value in a time when consumers seek it more pointedly?

As always, we've created mock-ups that you should take as inspiration, not necessarily dictation. Take the idea and shape it in the mold of your brand, your market, your customer.

## How to use Actionable Marketing

The ideas and examples that follow are meant to help you "connect the dots" between insights uncovered in our research and focus groups, ideas derived from them, and execution of those ideas.

You could copy and paste what we have here. But we strongly recommend that you adapt what is here to your brand's style, your market, and your target customer.

Also, we present the executions in specific formats or media, but consider transferring them to whatever is best for your marketing mix. The ideas and much of the copy are platform agnostic.

{% hint style="info" %}
Adapt these executions to your brand, market, and target customer rather than using them verbatim.

## The "Just Listed" Postcard

You, your team, an agent at your company, or one of your members gets a listing.

A "Just Listed" postcard is sent to nearby homeowners.

Box checked.

Your seller is satisfied. Another listing lead may be shaken loose. Fine.

But an opportunity may have been missed. What if we used this marketing piece to not just satisfy the seller, but wow them? What if we demonstrated to neighbors that there is a more imaginative, magnetic way to promote a property?

Do away with the "Just Listed" piece and introduce the "Just Wow" piece.

What we mean by that is to highlight the home's single most compelling attribute in highly creative terms through copy that stands out from the other real estate direct mail hitting peoples' inboxes.

Our research shows that marketing a property is the first or second most important thing in sellers' minds. Show them that you do it differently.

What follows are several examples of what we mean. Remember, these are just mock-ups. They serve to show you how this might come together.
