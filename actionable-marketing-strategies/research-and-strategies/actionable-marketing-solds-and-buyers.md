### Informational Vacuum: Mortgage Options for Buyers

#### November 2022

The ideas and examples that follow are meant to help you “connect the dots” between insights uncovered in our research and focus groups, ideas derived from them, and execution of those ideas.

We present the ideas and execution concepts here from an agent’s perspective. However, with slight modification, they can easily be adapted to work for a brokerage or team.

**Adapted** is a key word here. The execution examples here are fairly well-formed, but we recommend modifying them to reflect the unique attributes of your brand, your market, and your customer profiles.

#### Research Insight

Most people actively looking for a home (a good number of whom are also current or prospective sellers) are **not aware of mortgage discount points**, and do not consider the possibility of **refinancing to a lower rate in the future**, but respond favorably when presented with context or explanations of these things.

#### Idea

Fill the informational vacuum with a landing page dedicated to explaining things most buyers haven’t thought of. We recommend that this information be presented **without “now is a great time to buy” - type language**. Buying is tough for many people right now. Acknowledge that truth while casting light on potentially helpful options.

#### Execution: 3 Things Most Homebuyers Aren’t Thinking About Now, But Should

Is now a good time for you to buy a home? The answer is “maybe” until you know all your options. The affordability challenge is real, but we’re here to help.

**You can “buy down” a mortgage rate**

High mortgage rates mean higher monthly payments — possibly too high for you. However, you can effectively lower your monthly payment by “buying down” the mortgage rate. There are several ways to do this:

* **Paying points:** In many cases, you can pay 1% of the loan amount up front to lower your rate by .25% for the duration of the loan. This can reduce your monthly payment meaningfully if you have a little extra cash.
* **Seller-paid buydown:** It may be possible to negotiate a rate “buydown” paid by the seller. Here, the seller credits you an amount at closing that is placed into an escrow account your lender draws from over a set period (usually 1-3 years), reducing the amount you need to pay each month. Many sellers prefer this to reducing the sale price of their home.
* **Lender-paid buydown:** This is typically done via what are referred to as “3-2-1” or “2-1” mortgages, in which the lender pays to effectively lower your monthly payment for the first 1, 2, or 3 years of your term. This is not an adjustable rate mortgage (an ARM), but rather an upfront credit offered by lenders that is applied monthly for a period of time.

**You may be able to get grants or low to no-interest loans to help with your down payment or closing costs**

There are over **2,000 down payment assistance and closing cost programs** in the United States, and many right here in (City, county, town, region).

You may or may not qualify, but it’s worth checking, as most buyers don’t even know these programs exist. Down Payment Resource, a company that tracks these programs across the country, makes it easy for you you can do a quick search of programs and check your eligibility.

**You may be able to refinance to a lower rate in the future**

There’s an old saying in real estate: **“Marry the house, date the rate.”** It’s misleadingly simple, but does contain an element of truth.

The average rate for a 30-year mortgage rate was less than 3% in early 2021. It is now over 7%. Many economists expect rates to continue to increase in the coming months as the Federal Reserve attempts to curtail inflation. At a certain point, this could place the economy into a recession, which typically induces the Fed to reduce interest rates.

Of course, it is possible that rates remain high over a long period of time. There is a lot of uncertainty in forecasting this, so proceed with that understanding, and talk to a mortgage professional before making any assumptions.

### Engaging Sellers: Recent Sales Price Marketing

#### Research Insight

People who are considering selling right now value **recent sales price information highly**, and engage with marketing that features this information.

| Which kind of marketing materials do you find interesting or useful? | Percentage (%) |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Those that list recent home sales price                              | **39.35%**     |
| Those that offer statistics on the local market                      | 22.31%         |
| Those that highlight new listings                                    | 20.69%         |
| Those that offer free home price evaluations                         | 11.97%         |
| Those that promote a specific real estate agent’s skills             | 4.87%          |
| Other                                                                | 0.81%          |

#### Idea

Go deeper on recent sale price marketing, and making this information even more valuable to potential sellers, by adding **brief insights around the basic sales data**. This will differentiate your marketing while showcasing your local expertise. This could be done via postcard, as the example that follows illustrates, but can also be executed in an email newsletter or blog post.

### Post-Close Loyalty: Staying Engaged with Past Clients

#### Research Insight

**61% of people** we surveyed who have bought a home in the past three years **have not contacted their agent for assistance**. 46% of these people indicated that it **“did not occur to them to ask.”**

Of the 39% who did reach out to their agent, most initiated contact to get a recommendation for a service provider (e.g., plumber, painter, etc.) or an update on their home’s value.

#### Idea

Sometimes, simple things are hiding under the accumulated complexity of our experience. If it had “never occurred to” most people to tap their agent for post-close help, it likely “never occurs to” most agents or brokers to simply tell people that they can help in this way.

What if a simple email was sent at closing, and once a year, to your database to this effect?

#### Execution

_(The PDF image on page 14 showing an email example is not transcribable as text, but the concept is to explicitly state that the agent is available for post-close help.)_
