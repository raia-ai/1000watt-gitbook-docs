**Marketing Executions**

**December 2023**

**Turning Insights into Action**

***

## Introduction

Baby Boomers - those born between 1946 and 1964 - hold more real estate wealth than any other generation. According to the NAR, this cohort represented **32% of all buyers and 43% of sellers** this year.

But our tendency as an industry has been to focus on the preferences and behaviors of younger people. How many "Understanding Baby Boomers" conference panels have you witnessed?

That seems like a big miss. Because Baby Boomers are the greatest source of sellers leads in housing history — a source that seems poised to become even richer as mortgage rates ease into 2024.

So we dug in and did the research, exploring what people aged 59-76 see as the biggest impediment to selling, how they view the real estate professionals who might help them do so, and how they see their next chapter.

The marketing and advertising executions that follow are based directly on that research.

## How to Use Marketing Executions

The ideas and examples that follow are meant to help you "connect the dots" between insights uncovered in our research and focus groups, ideas derived from them, and execution of those ideas.

You could copy and paste what we have here. But we strongly recommend that you adapt what is here to your brand's style, your market, and your target customer.

Also, we present the executions in specific formats or media, but consider transferring them to whatever is best for your marketing mix. The ideas and much of the copy are platform agnostic.

## Research Insight: Online Browsing Behavior

Baby Boomers are far less engaged than younger consumers in online home browsing, even though nearly **20% say they plan to sell in the next one to five years.** "Zillow surfing" is not a thing. **72% say they look at homes online "rarely" or "never".**

## Idea: Highlight Long-Term Price Appreciation

What if we revised the typical "recent sales" postcard to note both the prior purchase price, and the new sale price to highlight the reality of long-term price appreciation?

If this group of homeowners isn't tracking sales and market dynamics online, we can show it simply in this way.

## Research Insight: Moving Logistics

Our research shows that **"logistics of planning and executing a move" is the most daunting challenge for Baby Boomers thinking about moving** — beating out even "finding another home I like".

### When you think of selling, what do you see as the biggest challenge?

* **38.67%** - Logistics of planning and executing a move
* **36.17%** - Finding another home I like
* **15.00%** - Rising interest rates
* **5.17%** - Being faced with a large tax bill
* **5.00%** - Other

## Idea: Address Moving Logistics Directly

What if we addressed the mental and practical hurdles of organizing a move from a long-time home directly, through social posts/ads and live neighborhood events in which you convene a number of experts who can speak to this issue?

## Idea: Create a Downsizing Program

Many brokerages, teams, or agents have renovation, buy-before-you-sell, or staging programs for sellers.

What if you became the one who had a **Downsizing Program** you could use in your listing presentation to sellers in that stage of life?
