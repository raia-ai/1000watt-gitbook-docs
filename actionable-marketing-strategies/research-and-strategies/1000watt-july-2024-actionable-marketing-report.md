_Turning insights into action_

## Introduction

In mid-June, 1000watt surveyed **630 practitioners** to understand their client interactions as the **August 17th implementation of settlement terms** approaches. The survey also explored practitioners' thoughts on their brokerage affiliation during this period of change.

Key questions addressed in the survey included:

* What are practitioners hearing (and not hearing) from their clients about upcoming changes?
* Are they speaking proactively about this issue? If so, how is that going?
* How many agents are changing brokerages now?
* What is driving this movement?
* How is settlement preparedness influencing their attitudes and decisions?
* What recruiting efforts are agents responding to, and not responding to?

> "At our Summit last month in Dallas, one of our speakers stated that whomever is closest to the consumer wins. This month’s Actionable Marketing helps get you there."

## Insight 1: The Elephant in the Room is a Mouse

### Research Insight

The NAR settlement and industry changes are widely discussed in the industry, but this is not reflected in consumer inquiries.

| Consumer Inquiry | Percentage of Practitioners |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| Yes, a lot       | 9%                          |
| Yes, sometimes   | 39%                         |
| Rarely           | 43%                         |
| No, never        | 9%                          |

**Key Takeaway:** More than half of practitioners (52% - Rarely or No, never) are **rarely or never** being asked about the settlement from consumers.

### Idea

Approach the "elephant in the room" as if it were the size of a mouse.

The idea is to **proactively direct the conversation** in a direction where everyone wins, rather than reactively responding from a stance that consumers might perceive as defensive.

### Execution: Social Carousel

A suggested execution is a social media carousel that addresses the topic directly but with an open invitation.

Carousel Copy:

* **Slide 1:** "The real estate headlines have been weird."
* **Slide 2:** "Consider this your open invitation to ask us about them."
* **Slide 3:** "After all, the only useless question is an unasked one."
* **Caption:** "If you’ve been wondering, we do have a plan for the coming real estate changes and are actively working to minimize disruption for each and every client we serve."

## Insight 2: Culture is the New Compensation

### Research Insight

Most agent movement between brokerages over the past two years was driven by factors **other than compensation**.

Even if compensation played a role, poor **leadership or culture** remained an active reason for agents being unhappy enough to move.

### Idea

Lean into more traditional **"soft" factors like culture** in your recruitment efforts.

While compensation is always part of the conversation, the idea is to **lead with demonstrating your culture** instead of mentioning it as an afterthought. You must **show, not tell**, the kind of leader you are and the culture you embody, as no one wants to be "hard" sold anymore.

### Execution: Website "Call Out"

A website call-out section can speak to the intrinsic value of leading with empathy and humility, providing a "soft" place for agents to land.

Website Copy Focus:

* **Headline:** "Do we feel like we’re on our own? No, and here’s why."
* **Body:** "To be a part of a team is to be a part of something bigger than yourself. It’s raising your hand and understanding that, sometimes, you need help. And that, more often than not, you don’t want to feel alone. 'Do we feel like we’re on our own?' is a question we ask ourselves daily, because authentic leadership and collaboration begins first with holding ourselves to the standard and vision we see for each of our agents."
* **Culture Statement:** "We understand that culture isn’t a 'build it and they will come' kind of thing. It takes effort. It takes time. It takes all of us."
* **Call to Action:** "If you agree, we’d love to hear from you. If you don’t, we wish you the best, and our door’s always open."

***

## Insight 3: Brand and Education are Equally Valued

### Research Insight

Agents value **brand and education equally** when considering brokerage affiliation.

* **Brand** is considered a "soft" factor, yet it remains a primary driver.
* **Education** is a "hard" skill.

The importance of a company's training program in affiliation decisions:

| Importance of Training Program                        | Percentage of Agents |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Very important, it’s the most important consideration | 30%                  |
| Important                                             | 50%                  |
| Somewhat important                                    | 10%                  |
| Not very important                                    | 7%                   |
| Not important at all                                  | 3%                   |

**Key Takeaway:** A combined **80%** of agents consider a company's training program to be **Important or Very Important**.

### Idea

Speak to the **emotional value of brand** as well as the **tangible value of education**.

The strategy is to lay everything on the table for potential recruits, treating them as you would want to be treated.

## Insight 4: Many Agents Feel "On My Own"

### Research Insight

One third of agents feel **"on my own"** to deal with industry changes following the NAR settlement.

| Broker/Company Response | Agent Sentiment                                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **One third of agents** | Feel "on my own" to deal with industry changes. |

**Key Takeaway:** If your company is prepared for the changes, this represents a **huge recruiting opportunity**. Address the fear directly.

### Idea

The survey indicated that a **personal email** was second only to a personal phone call in terms of recruiting pitches agents are likely to respond to.

The idea is to send prospects an email that speaks directly to your capacity to help them through this period of profound change.

### Execution: Personal Email

**Subject:** You don’t have to go it alone

Hi Lauren,

It’s Mike from ABC Realty. I just read a survey of agents nationwide that said **32% of them feel either “completely” or “largely” alone** to deal with the massive changes mandated by the NAR settlement.

Maybe you have all you need, but I want to let you know that we’ve been planning for these changes for over a year to make sure every one of our agents is **100% confident**. That means not just training on the legal stuff, or the new forms, but comprehensive support in articulating value to consumers in this new world.

We’re viewing this moment as a big opportunity. Many agents are scared, and many brokers have no idea how to help them. ABC is ready to win the day.

Reach out if you’d like to talk with me about how we can help you.

Best,\
Mike
