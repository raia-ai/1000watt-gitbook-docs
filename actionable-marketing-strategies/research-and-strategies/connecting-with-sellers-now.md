# connecting with sellers now

_A 1000WATT Insight Briefing (November 2023)_

## How to Use This Guide

The ideas and examples that follow are meant to help you **“connect the dots”** between insights uncovered in our research and focus groups, ideas derived from them, and the execution of those ideas.

You could copy and paste what we have here. But we strongly recommend that you **adapt what is here to your brand’s style, your market, and your target customer.**

Also, we present the executions in specific formats or media, but consider transferring them to whatever is best for your marketing mix. The ideas and much of the copy are platform agnostic.

## Insight 1: The Surprise of Ease

### Research Finding

> **32.9% of recent sellers** said “Promoting/marketing my home to attract buyers” was the most valuable service provided by their agent.

When we asked recent sellers the open-ended question, “what surprised you most about the home selling process?”, the most prevalent sentiment was **surprise at how easy it was.**

### Idea: Frame the Difficulty to Highlight Value

Mercedes Benz does not tell people it’s easy to create a luxury automobile. They speak to the cost and skill required to engineer something exquisite, while highlighting the end result the driver enjoys.

An in-demand doctor will be clear about risks and side effects with a patient, while also reassuring them that they are prepared to navigate them to a good outcome. Brain surgery isn’t easy, and neither is selling a house.

What if you frame it in these terms to highlight, rather than hide, value?

### Execution

_(The original PDF had two pages dedicated to "EXECUTION" without specific text. This section is a placeholder for the agent to fill in with a suggested execution based on the idea.)_

**Suggested Execution Strategy:**

Create a marketing piece titled: **"The Illusion of Easy: Why Your Agent's Skill is Your Greatest Asset."**

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Acknowledge the Sentiment

Start by acknowledging that many sellers are surprised by how _smooth_ the process felt.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Reveal the Work

Immediately pivot to explaining that the **smoothness is a direct result of the agent's expertise** and the complexity they managed behind the scenes.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Use Analogies

Employ the luxury car or skilled surgeon analogy to reinforce that true value lies in the mastery that makes the difficult look effortless.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Insight 2: The Stress of Negotiation

### Research Finding

Recent sellers found **“negotiation or back-and-forth with the buyers”** to be the most stressful part of their home sale — **by far**.

People don’t like haggling, especially when it comes to something as personal as their home.

### Idea: Share Negotiation Success Stories

Because people are often unaware of the skill needed to negotiate a real estate transaction, or even unaware that actual negotiation takes place, what if you shared stories (anonymized, of course) of successful negotiations on your website?

**Sellers don’t like to negotiate. Let them know you’re great at it.**

### Execution

_(The original PDF had one page dedicated to "EXECUTION" without specific text. This section is a placeholder for the agent to fill in with a suggested execution based on the idea.)_

**Suggested Execution Strategy:**

Develop a series of **"Negotiation Wins"** case studies for your website or listing presentation:

* **Title:** "How We Fought for an Extra $X,000 for Our Client"
* **Format:** A brief, anonymized story detailing:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### The Initial Situation

Describe the initial buyer offer/demand (e.g., low price, excessive repair requests).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### The Agent's Strategy

Explain the agent's strategic counter-move (e.g., leveraging inspection data, market comps).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### The Outcome

Share the final, successful outcome for the seller and emphasize that the agent handles the stress and complexity so the seller doesn't have to.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Insight 3: The Value of Social Media Marketing

### Research Finding

Sellers place a very high value on social media when it comes to marketing their listing. In fact, **“Promoting my home on social media” was the most valued marketing tactic**, beating out “Placing my home on Zillow” and “Putting my home on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS)” by a wide margin.

People love seeing their home in their social feed. It is also now perhaps the case that distribution through Zillow and the MLS is seen as **table stakes**.

### Idea: Showcase Social Media Case Studies

What if you integrated a case study of a successful listing promotion on social media in your listing presentation?

Show the posts and/or ads, explain the thinking behind the copy, show the metrics on reach and engagement, and conclude with the end result.

### Execution

_(The original PDF had one page dedicated to "EXECUTION" without specific text. This section is a placeholder for the agent to fill in with a suggested execution based on the idea.)_

**Suggested Execution Strategy:**

Create a single-page slide or digital handout for listing appointments:

* **Header:** "Beyond the MLS: Our Social Media Marketing Advantage"
* **Content:**
  * **Visual:** Screenshot of a high-performing social media ad (e.g., a "Coming Soon" video).
  * **Metrics:** Use bold numbers for impact: **15,000+** Views, **500+** Engagements, **3** Private Showings Generated.
  * **Strategy:** Briefly explain the targeting (e.g., "Targeted high-income buyers in a 5-mile radius with a lookalike audience").
  * **Result:** Connect the social media effort directly to the sale (e.g., "The buyer who closed on the home first saw it through this campaign.").
