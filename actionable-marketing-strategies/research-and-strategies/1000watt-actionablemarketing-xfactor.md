**Turning insights into action**

_Source: 1000watt, May 2024_

***

## Introduction

In mid-April, we surveyed 500 adults from across the country who had bought and sold a home in the past five years. We wanted to know what these experienced real estate consumers thought about buyer agents, commissions, and issues related to the coming changes to industry practices.

Our research has shown that at the end of the day, most people still **value the help of a real estate agent**. However, a portion of buyers are still confused about what their agent did for them, how that agent was compensated, and whether that service was or would be worth paying for.

To us, this means we must proactively address issues that will be increasingly salient as change unfolds. Here, we take insights from some of our research and shape it into **actionable marketing and messaging** that can be used to do just that.

## How to use Actionable Marketing

The ideas and examples that follow are meant to help you **“connect the dots”** between insights uncovered in our research and focus groups, ideas derived from them, and execution of those ideas.

You could copy and paste what we have here. But we strongly recommend that you **adapt what is here to your brand’s style, your market, and your target customer**.

Also, we present the executions in specific formats or media, but consider transferring them to whatever is best for your marketing mix. The ideas and much of the copy are platform agnostic.

## Research Insight 1: The Commission Perception Gap

**Statement:** "In recent years, technology has made it very easy to find homes, and it makes sense that the fees or commissions real estate agent charge should be less than they used to be."

> People are easily convinced that access to real estate information online should result in lower commissions. Many of our respondents (recent buyers, the majority of whom valued their agent) conclude that the availability of listings online means buyer agents aren’t adding as much value to the transaction as they previously did.

The average response to the 1-10 question (1=Strongly Disagree, 10=Strongly Agree) was **7.02**.

### Idea: Explain Full Buyer Representation

If people misunderstand the true nature of buyer representation, we should explain it to them. That means leaning much further into the idea of **full buyer representation** vs. “finding a home” as the value proposition a buyer’s agent brings.

This would take many forms to fully articulate, including a page on your website, an email, social posts, and a part of your onboarding process for buyer clients. The idea is to show and state explicitly what buyer representation means for your clients, and to constantly look for ways to capture the results that representation gives them.

### Execution: The Process Explanation

The idea is to give prospective buyers a simple, matter-of-fact, explanation of the process you will lead them through, in a linear fashion that allows you to highlight your value along the way.

When it comes time to make an offer on a property I will create an offer strategy that is competitive, but protects you from overpaying.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Negotiation

Upon acceptance of an offer, I will negotiate with seller agents and their clients to protect your money, and secure the best terms possible.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Transaction Management

Once we enter into contract with a seller, I will proactively lead your transaction from offer acceptance, through the lifting of contingencies, to close, as your advocate.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Idea: Make the Benefits Concrete

If people have trouble seeing the concrete benefits for buyer representation, make it concrete. Specifically, begin aggregating data points on your buyer transactions that illustrate your value, then use that data in your marketing.

### Execution: Data-Driven Marketing

The idea is to collect data around wins you’ve created for buyers, and numbers that substantiate your expertise, then use that data in your marketing.

Example Data Points:

* Helped **39 buyers** close on their chosen home in multiple offer situations.
* Average time it takes my active buyer clients to secure a home: **64 days**.
* Average number of offers my clients make before entering into contract on a home: **2.1**.
* Advised buyers not to make an offer on a home due to issues I saw in disclosures **47 times**.
* Average # of homes I personally tour each week in our area: **16**.
