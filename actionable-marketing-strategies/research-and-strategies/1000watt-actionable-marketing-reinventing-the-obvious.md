**Actionable Marketing: turning insights into action**

October 2024

***

## Introduction

> Asking questions about assumptions. An industry where best practices of the past can no longer be reliable. The path of $5 million agents and 10,000 brokerages chasing $1 million home sales produces a result that demands differentiation. As consumers internalize new rules and develop new expectations, **reinvention is wise, both strategically and tactically.**

We are therefore introducing a new series as part of **Actionable Marketing** where we are calling **"Reinventing the Obvious."** In each installment, we'll take a simple but important element of real estate marketing, branding, or communication and think about how it can be made meaningfully more impactful. We start by asking the following questions:

* How can we take this commonplace marketing piece and make it a more powerful tool?
* How can we use it to elevate our brand, our market, and our customer?

As always, we create blueprints that you should take as inspiration, not necessarily dictation. Take the idea and shape it into the mold of your brand, your market, and your customer.

## The “Just Listed” Postcard

What is the basic structure you should make it easier for your target customer?

### The Basic Structure

* **Property Details:** Highlight the most compelling attributes through crisp, creative terms.
* **Stand Out:** What stands out from the other real estate direct mail hitting people's mailboxes?
* **Seller Satisfaction:** Another listing postcard may be shared with a neighbor. **Why?**
* **Research:** Our research shows that marketing a property is the **first or second most important thing** in a seller's mind. Show them that this opportunity may have been missed. What if we used this to show your different approach?
* **Marketing Piece:** A marketing piece to not "just list" the seller, but "wow" them.
* **Neighborhood Demonstration:** What if we demonstrated to the neighborhood that there is a **more imaginative, magnetic way** to promote a property?
