# 1000watt winning the talent war actionable marketing

## Introduction

1000watt surveyed agents across the U.S. during the week of May 29th, 2023. Each respondent was a member of the National Association of Realtors and had completed at least 6 transactions in 2022.

The results revealed insights that can be applied to your strategy for recruiting and retaining agent talent. **Outside** helps you connect those insights to ideas and executable tactics.

## How to use Outside

The ideas and examples that follow are meant to help you “connect the dots.” We present the ideas and execution concepts here from the perspective of a fictitious broker, **ABC Realty**. However, with slight modification, they can easily be adapted to work for a team.

**Adapted** is a key word here. The execution examples here are fairly well-formed, but we recommend modifying them to reflect the unique attributes of your brokerage or team, your market, competitive landscape, and the agent profile you are targeting.

## Insight 1: Conflation of Tech and Marketing

### Research Insight

53.37% of respondents said **tech was the most important factor** in their evaluation of a brokerage, but 52.64% also claimed, in response to the very next question, that **brand image and quality of marketing materials was most important**. In our experience, tech and marketing are often conflated in broker/agent conversations, and agents are often genuinely confused about what they really need from a brokerage or team.

#### Technology Importance

| Answer               | Answer (%) |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| Very important       | 53.37%     |
| Important            | 36.06%     |
| Somewhat important   | 7.21%      |
| Not very important   | 2.16%      |
| Not important at all | 1.20%      |

_Question: How important is technology when thinking about which brokerage to affiliate with?_

#### Brand/Marketing Importance

| Answer                                                | Answer (%) |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Very important, it’s the most important consideration | 52.64%     |
| Important                                             | 39.90%     |
| Somewhat important                                    | 4.81%      |
| Not very important                                    | 1.92%      |
| Not important at all                                  | 0.72%      |

_Question: How important is a company’s brand image and quality of marketing materials when thinking about which brokerage to affiliate with?_

{% hint style="info" %}
It’s hard to get people excited about a CRM or an open house flyer; people are much more easily drawn to narratives about the truth they are feeling in the moment. What if we created a tech or marketing story that leads with the **emotional benefit** that underlies both of these things?

## Insight 2: Preferred Recruiting Outreach Method

### Research Insight

The research is clear: Agents **hate getting recruiting texts**. But **30.05%** said they are most likely to consider a pitch via **social messaging**. Sliding into a recruit’s DMs has a slight edge over a phone call/voicemail (preferred by 29.50% of respondents), or personal email (preferred by 27.40% of respondents). We suspect that the informal, perhaps even conversational feel of a social DM can be effective if the tone is right.

#### Preferred Recruiting Outreach

| Answer               | Answer (%) |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| Social messaging     | **30.05%** |
| Phone call/voicemail | 29.50%     |
| Personal email       | 27.40%     |
| Direct mail          | 7.45%      |
| Text message         | 3.37%      |

_Question: What kind of recruiting outreach/pitch are you most likely to consider?_

{% hint style="info" %}
If self-promotion is cringe, then reaching out to someone directly in order to self-promote, to borrow a term from Gen-Z’s vernacular, is **peak cringe**. So if you’re reaching out to younger prospects, don’t be that company. What if you acknowledge the somewhat awkward nature of the message, or **“embrace the cringe,”** thereby positioning your company as one that does things differently?

## Insight 3: Agent Movement vs. Satisfaction

### Research Insight

**32%** of our agent respondents reported changing brokerages in the past 2 years. Agents move a lot. This stood somewhat at odds with respondents’ reported satisfaction level with their current brokerage, which average **8.44** on a scale of 1-10 (1 being “extremely unhappy,” and 10 being “extremely happy”), and the fact that **27.27%** reported that a recruiting pitch led to them changing brokers. Clearly, agents who claim to be happy are moving.

#### Agent Movement

| Question                                                      | Answer | Answer (%) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Have you changed brokerages in the past 2 years?              | Yes    | **32.21%** |
|                                                               | No     | 67.79%     |
| Did this pitch or pitches result in your changing brokerages? | Yes    | **27.27%** |
|                                                               | No     | 72.73%     |

{% hint style="info" %}
32% of our agent respondents reported changing brokerages in the past 2 years. That’s a lot. However, this stands somewhat at odds with the satisfaction level respondents claimed with their current brokerage, which averaged 8.44 on a scale of 1-10, as well as the fact that 27.27% reported that a recruiting pitch led to them changing brokers. We hypothesize that some purportedly happy agents respond - and act upon - recruiting pitches not because most pitches are effective, but because a pitch gives the recipient the **permission and confidence to pursue a change**.

What if we were explicit about this?
