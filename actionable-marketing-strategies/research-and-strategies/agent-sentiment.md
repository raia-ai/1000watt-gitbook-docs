# agent sentiment

**August 2023**

## Introduction

In mid-July, we fielded a survey of over 1,000 agents nationwide to deepen our understanding of what they are thinking about their prospects right now, what broker services matter to them, and where they are getting business. The survey was fielded in partnership with BAM, an innovative real estate media company with unique insights on agents and teams.

We segmented the responses into solo agents, agents on a team, and team leaders – three distinct and vastly different groups – to better understand each perspective. These insights are meant to help brokers speak directly to the desires of their target agents.

What follows are recruiting campaign concepts based directly on what our research found.

## Research Insight: Agent Optimism

Agents, both solo and team, are optimistic about their business in the current market. **93% of all respondents, and 95% of team leaders are planning to stay in the business over the next year.** Knowing that optimism is a safeguard in a business known to be brutally discouraging, there's an opportunity to mirror that sentiment in your recruiting efforts.

### On a scale of 1 to 10, how do you view the future of your real estate business over the next 6 months?

## Idea: Mirror the Optimism

Interest rates are high, home prices are high, and agent spirit is… also high? We know that real estate agents are more optimistic than most, as the job necessitates, and our recent research is consistent with this. It could mean that respondents believe we are at or near the bottom of the market, and that things can only improve from here.

What if you leaned into and mirrored this optimism, rather than emphasizing the anxieties of the current market conditions?

We all know that positive people are more pleasant to do business with, why not embody that positivity in your recruiting messaging? The details of the value position will vary based on your strengths, but tone is the key element here.

## Research Insight: Lead Dependency

Third-party lead dependency is high. A significant number of all respondents pay for leads from a third party (**35% of solo agents; 47% of team leaders**). And while both agents and team leaders expressed a very high confidence in their ability to convert leads, satisfaction with their primary lead provider was tepid.

**The biggest complaint: Poor quality leads.**

Leads are clearly a subject characterized by ambivalence, and it would be fair to surmise that many view them as a necessary evil. Brokerages that can address this (coaching, training, an internal lead program, marketing support) have an opportunity to connect with potential recruits on this issue.

## Idea: Address Lead Quality Concerns

35% of solo agents and 47% of team leaders are buying leads, and poor quality leads are their top concern. What if recruiting marketing materials addressed the elephant in the room and offered an antidote in the form of coaching, training, an internal lead program, or marketing support?

Again, maybe you don't have an internal lead program, but do offer training on sphere marketing that empowers agents to grow without lead dependency. Focus on your strength.

## Research Insight: Marketing Services Adoption

Agents "adopt" their broker's marketing services at a high rate. Over **40% of all respondents claim to use the marketing services of their broker or team "very often."** Knowing how adoption of broker-provided tech frequently falls well below that, marketing support may be viewed as an area in which to place greater emphasis in recruiting efforts.

**Marketing means staff.** Respondents reported that they value marketing staff support over marketing software, data, prospect lists, predictive analytics, and personal branding. But staff is about the last thing most brokers want to add right now. What to do?

Perhaps consider different staff that does different things. For example, respondents reported that organic (non-paid) social media is very important to their businesses, yet most brokers provide little or no support or services in this area.

## Idea: Showcase Your Marketing Team

The research confirms what we've always known — that real estate is a people business, i.e. respondents reported they value marketing staff over marketing software. If marketing means staff, and you have a stellar support team at your company, show off their skills and knowledge. Being personable and responsive is a skill, so is knowing how to build a Squarespace site.

## Execution: Marketing Staff Showcase

**Caption:** Marketing is so much more than a CMA tool and a platform you log into. Whether you need social media strategy or a custom brochure, our marketing staff is here to help. Our average turnaround time is 3 days for design, and we answer every agent's email before the end of every day.

## Research Insight: Marketing Services Dissatisfaction

On the other hand... **31% of all agent respondents said they "rarely" or "never" used their broker or team's marketing services.** When we asked these folks why they did not rely upon these services, the feedback was, shall we say, strong. Here's a sample:

<details>

<summary>Sample agent feedback on marketing services</summary>

> "They suck."

> "Our marketing support services create more work than doing it myself."

> "I'm already better at marketing than they are."

> "My broker's marketing material sucks. It's 'you can use the printers for free and mailers.'"

> "The materials they produce are not up to my standards."

</details>

## Idea: Target Sophisticated Agents

**\[Note: We recommend you use this approach only if you are confident that your marketing offering compares favorably to most of your competitors!]**

If nearly a third of agents (we suspect the most productive, sophisticated third) are forced to pay their broker or team lead for marketing they don't use, then let's give them a compelling proposition: Marketing services they want to use, a potential cost savings from no longer having to pay for it themselves, and the potential for more business good marketing brings.
