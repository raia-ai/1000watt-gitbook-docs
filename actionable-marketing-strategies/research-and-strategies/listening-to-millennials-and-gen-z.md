## How to Use Outside

The ideas and examples that follow are meant to help you "connect the dots" between insights uncovered in our research and focus groups, ideas derived from them, and execution of those ideas.

We present the ideas and execution concepts here from an agent's perspective. However, with slight modification, they can easily be adapted to work for a brokerage or team.

**Adapted** is a key word here. The execution examples here are fairly well-formed, but we recommend modifying them to reflect the unique attributes of your brand, your market, and your customer profiles.

## Introduction

In April 2023, we surveyed 600 Millennial and Gen Z Americans who currently do not own a home. We wanted to understand how they thought about homeownership, what they knew and did not know about what it took to buy, and how they reacted to messaging about the current market.

Their answers revealed a number of opportunities for speaking to these younger prospects with more understanding, and addressing their needs and misconceptions about home buying in novel ways.

## Research Insight: Desire for Homeownership

A vast majority (**95%**) of Millennial and Gen Z respondents express a desire to own a home, in spite of high rates and high prices. These would-be buyers are driven by emotional sentiments like pride of ownership and a place to call home, more than investing and building wealth. **68% think that ownership is required for a "place to truly feel like home."**

It's clear that home ownership is important to this cohort, and they're likely to be moved by marketing that speaks to the heart. Nevertheless, you aren't going to convince them with a blanket "now is a great time to buy" statement. No one's buying it.

Consistent with our previous studies, people find conditional messaging more credible. For example, **"Now may be a good time to buy a home if you truly desire to own your own place and can negotiate good terms with a seller"** was viewed as far more credible than "Now is a great time to buy because prices have stopped rising."

## Research Data

### Do you want to buy a home at some point in the future?

* **95.50%** - Yes
* **4.50%** - No

### What is the primary reason you want to own a home?

* **39.79%** - Financial/rational reasons — buying a home is good investment and builds wealth
* **59.16%** - Emotional/lifestyle reasons — pride of ownership, a place for me/my family to call home etc.

### Which of these statements strikes you as MOST credible?

* **20.07%** - Now is a great time to buy a home because prices have stopped rising
* **33.16%** - Now is a bad time to buy a home because mortgage interest rates are very high
* **46.77%** - Now may be a good time to buy a home if you truly desire to own your own place and can negotiate good terms with a seller

## Idea: Tell the Unvarnished Truth

What if we told the unvarnished truth about home ownership? What if we speak to Millennial and Gen Z hearts and rationality with a message that both acknowledges their reality and addresses what really matters?

## Execution: Email/Buyer Letter

**Subject line:** It isn't easy right now

Name,

You've heard it all, and so have we. Interest rates are high. Prices aren't softening enough. There aren't enough homes for sale.

It's tough out there. And anyone you hear shouting "Now's a great time to buy!" from the rooftops is someone to be avoided.

Still, if you want to live somewhere you can truly call home, it can be done. But the calculation is deeply personal.

Here are some things to think about to determine whether or not it's a good time to buy for you:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Start with monthly payment

If you look at buying through the lens of what you can afford for a monthly payment first, rather than home prices, you will have a more approachable starting point for thinking about homeownership. It will also force you to think through your monthly budget. Things will get more real more quickly.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Weigh how much you really want it

Go ahead, paint it orange. There are things you just can't do as a renter. Home ownership is a profoundly rewarding experience. It's not all about dollars and cents. So weigh your emotions. Do you really value the feeling of homeownership? Or do you view it through an investment/financial lens?
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Get real about your time horizon

Time dilutes risk, and makes certain questions less important. Will home prices go up over the next year? Will mortgage rates go down? If you think you can buy a home you can live in for 30 years, these questions aren't as heavy. If you're thinking it's maybe 5 years until you'll want to move, you need to think hard about these things.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

If this sounds like buying a home requires a lot of reflection, well, that's because it's the truth. This is a big life decision.

If you've done your thinking, and want to talk with someone who can guide you through the first steps of the journey, \[I/we/company name] are here.

When the time is right for you.

## Research Insight: Family Financial Help

**37% of respondents said they anticipated getting help from parents or family when they buy a home.** The same amount said this was "possible." Only 26% responded "no." Clearly, home buying for younger adults is a multigenerational affair. While it would require great sensitivity, it does not seem preposterous to consider marketing to both Gen Z, Millennials and their Gen X or Baby Boomer parents along these lines.

### Do you anticipate getting financial help from parents/family for buying a home?

* **36.82%** - Yes
* **37.17%** - Possibly
* **26.00%** - No

## Idea: Address Multigenerational Home Buying

What if we addressed the elephant in the room, and provide guidance around a thing tons of people are already doing, but having to figure out on their own?

What if you could be the brokerage, team or agent that was the recognized expert in this area?

Why not host a seminar - either at your office, or via Zoom - titled: **Family help and first-time home buying: Taxes, Title, and making it work.**

## Execution: Seminar Invitation

This copy and graphic could be used in an email, on social, or as a flyer in your office window:

**Subject:** Family help and first-time home buyers

Name,

More and more parents and grandparents are helping younger family members buy their first home. A recent study of younger renters revealed that 37% "expect" some manner of help from family, and another 37% say it's "possible."

But it can be complicated. How should you handle title? What are the tax implications? Should this be looked at as an investment or a gift? And how do you avoid the pitfalls of mixing money with family?

Join us for a candid discussion of all this on **\[date/time]** at **\[location]**. You'll hear from people who made it work - both parents and children - a real estate tax expert, and real estate professionals who have seen it all.

Bring your questions. We'll give you answers. This is not a "now is a great time to buy" pitch. Quite the opposite. It's addressing something that happens all the time, but is seldom talked about, so you can come to your own conclusions.

Best regards,

## Research Insight: Down Payment Misconceptions

When we gauge respondents' understanding of down payment requirements, **36% seem to understand the variable reality, but more than a third answer with the "typical" 20%.** There remains an obvious opportunity for educational, or problem/solution marketing here.

### How much of a down payment do you believe is needed to buy a home?

* **17.21%** - 10% of the purchase price
* **7.79%** - 5% of the purchase price
* **33.61%** - 20% of the purchase price
* **35.66%** - It depends on the kind of loan you get, and varies
* **5.74%** - I have no idea

## Idea: Educate on Down Payment Reality

What if we simply told young would-be homebuyers the truth: **Almost half of all homebuyers bought a home with less than 20% down in 2022?**

## Execution: Social Media Post

_\[Visual post example would be included here based on the PDF content]_

## Execution: IG Reel Script

**Myth:** You always need a 20% down payment to buy your first home.

**Fact:** According to an April 2022 survey from the National Association of Realtors, 44% of homebuyers put less than 20% down.

It may or may not be the right time for you to buy a home, but make sure to start with the right assumptions.

**Caption:**\
Millions of Gen Z and Millennial Americans will buy homes in the coming years. Almost half will do it without a 20% down payment.
