## How to Use Outside

The ideas and examples that follow are meant to help you “connect the dots” between insights uncovered in our research and focus groups, ideas derived from them, and execution of those ideas.

We present the ideas and execution concepts here from an agent’s perspective. However, with slight modification, they can easily be adapted to work for a brokerage or team.

**Adapted** is a key word here. The execution examples here are fairly well-formed, but we recommend modifying them to reflect the unique attributes of your brand, your market, and your customer profiles.

## IDEA 1: Differentiate on a Point of View

### Research Insight

There is a lot of real estate marketing and advertising directed at homeowners. And, interestingly, they seem to actually consume it, which leads to high awareness of real estate options. People know a lot of real estate agents. Customer defection is always a call, text, or email away.

### Idea

Many teams and agents subscribe to a “personal” branding that relies on photos — usually headshots — paired with a limited number of offers or content (free home valuation, recent solds, etc.). Many brokers equate their logo with “branding.” This is fine, but shallow.

What if we cut through the volume of real estate marketing and advertising, and increased recall, by differentiating on a point of view?

Clarifying your brand’s point of view is something that requires serious consideration. (Schedule a one-on-one with us if you you’d like help shaping yours.) For the concepts that follow, we illustrate a fictitious team with a point of view that **“Selling your home is a high-stakes transaction that should be assisted by only the most skilled of real estate professionals.”**

### Execution

(Content for this section was primarily visual/design-focused in the original PDF, showing examples of marketing materials. The core concept is to execute the "point of view" branding.)

## IDEA 2: Be the "Truth Telling" Company on Compensation

### Research Insight

Many of our homeowners said they would consider a discount real estate company if they were selling their current home. However, when we presented these same people with a hypothetical scenario that detailed what a “traditional” agent might make for selling their home, a large majority were comfortable with it. Our earlier research with recent buyers indicated that over half had only a vague idea of how their agent got paid, or had no idea.

| Question                                                                                                                                                    | Answer             | Answer (%)  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| If you were selling and buying again now, would you consider “discount” real estate services that offer lower commissions to sellers, or rebates to buyers? | Yes, definitely    | 31.00%      |
|                                                                                                                                                             | Yes, maybe         | 48.67%      |
|                                                                                                                                                             | No, probably not   | 12.00%      |
|                                                                                                                                                             | No, definitely not | 8.33%       |
| **Total**                                                                                                                                                   |                    | **100.00%** |

**Hypothetical Scenario:**

> You list your house for sale for $500,000. Your real estate agent helps prepare your home, hosts some open houses, places your home on Zillow and the local MLS, and handles the paperwork. Your home sells for the price you want. This takes a total of 40 hours and their commission is $12,500 — or $312.50 per hour.

| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| Do you think your agent got paid too much in this scenario? | No, not at all  | 27.56%      |
|                                                             | No, not really  | 44.89%      |

### Idea

If people respond positively to detailed explanations of compensation, then be the “truth telling” company, team, or agent in your market and build trust with people through a detailed, candid explanation of compensation.

### Execution (Sample Content)

(Content in the original was garbled; the following is a reconstruction consistent with the original intent.)

For Sellers

* We offer a detailed breakdown of where every dollar of our commission goes.
* We explain the value of our time and expertise, showing how $X commission translates to $Y/hour for 40 hours of work, similar to the hypothetical scenario.
* We are transparent about what we do to earn our fee.

For Buyers

* We explain how the buyer's agent is compensated, often through the seller's commission.
* We clarify that our services are "free" to the buyer at the point of transaction, but we are still paid for our work.
* We detail what we do to earn our fee.

<details>

<summary>Common Questions We Answer Upfront</summary>

* Are your fees/commissions negotiable?
* Aren’t there companies that charge less than you do?
* Does the seller pay the buyer's commission?
* What if my home doesn't sell, or I decide not to buy?

## IDEA 3: Anticipate and Support Homeowner Needs

### Research Insight

Contrary to speculation, our results show that most recent buyers (our respondents all bought within the past three years) are happy that they purchased a home. However, the biggest challenge they face is **“ongoing maintenance costs.”** These costs are both financial and psychic.

| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| What is the biggest challenge you have owning a home? | Ongoing maintenance costs             | 42.83%      |
|                                                       | Stress about my home’s value          | 20.33%      |
|                                                       | Affording my monthly mortgage payment | 34.17%      |
|                                                       | Other                                 | 2.67%       |
| **Total**                                             |                                       | **100.00%** |

### Idea

What if we anticipated this need by turning what many practitioners already do — act as a support resource for their homeowner clients — into a program?

Examples of a program:

* A “Team ABC Homeowner’s Club” Facebook group.
* An “ABC Guide to Home Owning” booklet presented at closing.

### Execution

(Content for this section was primarily visual/design-focused in the original PDF, showing examples of a "Homeowner's Club" program. The core concept is to execute the post-sale support program.)
