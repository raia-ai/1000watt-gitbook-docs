# making the case

**April 5, 2024**

## Introduction

Last month we held a webinar explaining our view of the challenge presented by the proposed NAR settlement, and how 1000WATT Members could meet it. You can watch the recording of that webinar here, and many of the marketing examples we showed can be found in the Actionable Marketing section of your Member Center.

Here, though, we condensed our argument for how to make the case for your value into one slide deck you can use to move forward, or share with your team.

We hope you enjoy it.

## The Problem

### People don't know what a good buyer agent is.

### People don't know what a bad buyer agent is.

### They just know a ton of agents.

***

## Research Insight: Agent Payment Transparency

### Did the real estate agent who helped you buy your home explain, up front, how they were to get paid?

* **55%** - Yes
* **45%** - No

### Are you clear now on how the agent who helped you buy got paid for their work?

* **26%** - Yes
* **74%** - No

***

## Research Insight: Agent Saturation

### How many people do you know (neighbors, relatives, friends, acquaintances, people you know from your kids' school, your church, etc.) who are real estate agents?

* **15%** - None
* **34%** - 1-5
* **29%** - 6-10
* **17%** - 11-20
* **4%** - 21 or more

**Average: 13.6 agents**

***

## The Challenge

### Ignorance is dangerous.

### Nature abhors a vacuum.

### If you don't tell your story, somebody else will.

***

## Research Insight: Impact of Lawsuits

### On a scale of 1 to 10, how do you react to the following statement: The recent lawsuits in the real estate industry have made me question the value of real estate agents.

* **Average: 6.9**
* **39% scored 8 or higher**

### On a scale of 1 to 10, how do you react to the following statement: I am now more likely to seek out alternative real estate services or platforms that offer lower commission rates if I buy or sell a home in the future.

* **Average: 7.08**
* **44.37% scored 8 or higher**

***

## The Opportunity

### People have generally been cool with how much agents are paid.

***

## Research Insight: Commission Perception

**Real estate agents who work with buyers usually get paid a fee equal to 2.5% of the purchase price of the home their client buys. For example, an agent would get paid $12,500 on a $500,000 house purchase. Based on this, do you think…**

* **53%** - Real estate agents who work with buyers get paid about right.
* **21%** - Real estate agents who work with buyers probably get paid too much.
* **15%** - Real estate agents who work with buyers definitely get paid too much.
* **11%** - Real estate agents who work with buyers don't get paid enough.

***

## Research Insight: Who Pays?

**Currently, in most real estate transactions, the agent representing the buyers is paid about 2.5% of the home's sales price. This commission is determined by the seller and their agent before the home is listed for sale, and comes out of the seller's sale proceeds at the close of the transaction. How do you interpret this?**

### Do you think the buyer is paying for their agent's services?

* **65%** - The buyer is paying the 2.5% that goes to their agent because the buyer is the source of money in the transaction
* **35%** - The buyer is paying nothing for their agent's services

### Does this seem fair?

* **94%** - Yes
* **6%** - No

***

## Research Insight: Buyer Agreement Impact

**Currently, these things are true: Most homebuyers do not have to sign any kind of exclusive agreement or contract to hire a real estate agent. Most home buyers do not pay their real estate agent "out of pocket" for their services because their agent's commission was distributed at the close of the transaction from money that is usually borrowed. If you had to sign an agreement to work exclusively with one real estate agent and had to pay "out of pocket" for their services what would you do?**

* **53%** - I would have some reservations, but would probably still hire an agent to represent me
* **16%** - I would probably seek agents who offered lower fees or allowed me to work with other agents
* **14%** - I would be fine with this
* **8%** - I would just work with the agent representing the sellers

***

## Research Insight: Willingness to Pay

**If you were buying a home today, and your budget was $500,000, how much would you be willing to pay for the services of a real estate agent to guide you through the process?**

* **37%** - $10,000
* **17%** - $7,500
* **15%** - $12,500
* **14%** - $5,000
* **12%** - $2,500
* **5%** - $15,000

***

## But people's views are also highly malleable.

***

## Research Insight: Agent Necessity

### Which of these statements do you agree with more?

* **70%** - It is worth paying a real estate agent to help you buy a home because it is a big, complex purchase requiring the expert guidance of a professional.
* **30%** - It really isn't necessary to hire a real estate agent to help you buy a home because all the homes for sale are online and you can just work with the agent who is selling the home (the "listing" agent).

***

## Research Insight: International Comparison

**In countries other than the United States, most homebuyers do not have a real estate agent representing them in transactions and instead rely on the seller's agent to coordinate the transaction and provide information about the home. What do you think about this?**

* **71%** - I think it is a bad idea and leaves the home buyer vulnerable
* **28%** - I think it makes sense and seems simpler than having two agents involved
* **1%** - Other

***

## Research Insight: Car Dealership Analogy

**Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: "We don't walk into a car dealership with a buyer agent representing us, and we buy from the salesperson representing the seller. There are also laws protecting car buyers. It should be the same way with buying a home — just buy from the salesperson representing the seller."**

* **53%** - I agree strongly
* **34%** - I agree
* **11%** - I disagree
* **2%** - I disagree strongly

***

## The Imperative

So… if most people never had an organic objection to comp levels, but are now blitzed with anti-Realtor messages, brokers, agents, brands, and everyone else in the business has just one job now.

### Make the case.

***

## The Reality

This is a positioning and marketing problem, and a positioning and marketing opportunity.

**Those with a strong value story will prosper.**

**Those without a strong value story will succumb.**

***

## The Case: What Buyers Value Most

**What do you think is the MOST valuable service the agent who helped you buy your home provided?**

* **33%** - Interpreting inspection and disclosure reports about properties, and noting potential issues
* **17%** - Evaluating the pros and cons of homes I/we were interested in
* **11%** - Negotiating with the sellers agent on the price and the terms of the transaction
* **11%** - Touring/showing homes with me/us
* **10%** - Finding homes
* **9%** - Recommending other pros (mortgage provider, insurance provider, etc.)
* **7%** - Helping me/us determine what an offer price should be
* **2%** - Providing emotional support, encouragement, or a sounding board
* **1%** - Other

***

## Research Insight: Most Valuable Service

**Which of these statements do you think is most true?**

* **55%** - A real estate agent can help buyers make smarter decisions by looking at the pros and cons of a home, translating inspection and disclosure reports, or interpreting fine print in the paperwork.
* **25%** - A real estate agent can find houses for sale that you might not see online.
* **21%** - A real estate agent who works for buyers can often get a better deal from the seller and their agents.

***

## Research Insight: Why Agents Aren't Necessary

**Why do you feel that the services of a real estate agent are not necessary when buying a home?**

* **45%** - Because I can find homes for sale myself online, and tour them at open houses.
* **38%** - Because it seems simpler to me to just work with the agent representing the seller.
* **16%** - Because I don't think what real estate agents do is hard, and am confident I can do it myself.
* **1%** - Other

***

## Menu of Services: What Buyers Really Need

* Give me the confidence to do something scary and life-changing.
* Ask and find answers for the things I don't know to ask.
* Tell me what is and is not a problem with the house I want to buy.
* Use data and knowledge born from experience to help me know what is enough to offer, and what is too much.

***

## Menu of Services (Continued)

* Protect my money from a listing agent obligated to get as much of it for their client as they can.
* Leverage your relationships with everyone from house cleaners to loan officers to make sure I get everything I need.
* Help me not screw it up and end up bankrupt, divorced, or consumed with regret.
