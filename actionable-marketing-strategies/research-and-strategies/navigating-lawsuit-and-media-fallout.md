**Actionable Marketing: Turning Insights into Action**

***

## Introduction

A jury in Kansas City decided that the National Association of Realtors and several large real estate companies had conspired to overcharge for real estate services.

All hell broke loose.

Copycat lawsuits. Unfavorable media coverage through almost every major outlet. A fumbling industry response. The real estate industry became famous in the worst possible way.

We wanted to assess how all of this landed with consumers. In late December we surveyed 1,000 people nationwide who were aware of the class-action decision in order to find out. We filtered out agents, brokers, real estate investors, and people in the title and closing business.

What we found out isn't good news. Most people align with the plaintiff's point of view. Most are also now more inclined to view real estate agents more negatively. More consumers question the value of a real estate agent in light of this episode.

But what is most important now is how you respond to this reality. This edition of Actionable Marketing, available only to 1000watt Members, is designed to help you respond more effectively than your competitors. Here you will find marketing, messaging, and ad ideas from the 1000watt team that are drawn directly from the insights drawn from our research.

## How to Use Actionable Marketing

The ideas and examples that follow are meant to help you "connect the dots" between insights uncovered in our research and focus groups, ideas derived from them, and execution of those ideas.

## Research Insight: Online Home Search

Consumers who question buyer agents' value often do so because they "can find homes for myself online". Many of our respondents equate buyer agent value with finding homes, which is among the least valuable things a good agent does.

### Why do you feel that the services of a real estate agent are not necessary when buying a home?

* **45%** - Because I can find homes for sale myself online, and tour them at open houses.
* **38%** - Because it seems simpler to me to just work with the agent representing the seller.
* **16%** - Because I don't think what real estate agents do is hard, and am confident I can do it myself.
* **1%** - Other

## Idea: Educate About Online Search

What if we pulled back the curtain on home search to expose things people likely don't know about the big search apps/sites, while also de-emphasizing the importance of home search in our value proposition?

This would take the form of an email, a page on your website, or a part of your onboarding process for buyer clients.

### The Insider's Guide to Online Home Search

There are tens of thousands of home search websites and apps. You probably know Zillow, Realtor.com, and Redfin. But there are so many more, including our own ABC Realty home search.

Which is the best? Do some sites or apps have more listings than others? How does a company like Zillow make money, anyway?

We're going to tell you, everything, straight up. Including this: Our ABC Realty search is good, but we're more than happy if you use one of the well-known apps. Just be aware of the important details below — important details many companies are happy to have you not know!

#### Helping you find homes is among the least important things an agent will do for you

Very occasionally, an agent will hear about a "coming soon" listing that has yet to hit the market, and sometimes sellers that do not wish to have their home displayed online for privacy reasons.

But these things are rare. It is almost always the case that the homes you see for sale online are the same homes your agent sees. At ABC Realty, our true value lies in helping our clients evaluate homes (reading disclosures, interpreting inspection reports, walking through homes together, estimating repair costs) and negotiating the best terms possible with sellers. Buying a home is a big deal. Our #1 job is making sure you get it right.

#### Pretty much every search site has pretty much all the listings

Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com, us… we all get our listings from the same place: The Multiple Listing Service, or MLS. The MLS is the local database of homes for sale that real estate agents use. There are over 400 MLSs in the United States, and they account for almost all homes for sale at any given time.

This means that the search results you see on our site will be the same as what you will see on most any other home search app or site.

#### But not all home search experiences are the same

Which user experience you prefer is up to you. Some prioritize searching on a map; others default to showing results as a list. Some are simple; some offer every feature imaginable.

The most meaningful differences lie in the business model of the company behind the search. For example, Zillow and Realtor.com do not actually help people buy and sell homes, so when you click a button on a listing that says "contact agent" or "schedule showing" you are referred out to a real estate agent who has a relationship with Zillow or Realtor.com. In some cases, these sites charge agents a fee equal to as much as 35% of the commission the agent earns on the transaction. That's money that comes out of the buyer's pocket, but the search sites don't tell you that unless you click deeply into their terms of use.

When you search on the ABC Realty site, your contact or showing requests go to a member of the ABC team.

#### About Redfin

Redfin's search app is great — it's easy to use, fast, and loaded with content. So use it, but be aware that when you click to schedule a showing you are often being connected with a "door opener", a person with a real estate license who actually doesn't help people transact and may have little or no experience. Again, this is not something that is clearly disclosed.

When you search on the ABC Realty site, your showing requests go to a member of the ABC team — an experienced, highly trained agent prepared to help you navigate every aspect of a real estate transaction.

#### The bottom line

We tell our client to use the search site or app they like best, but to coordinate showings and other offline functions with their ABC Agent. This ensures that they are getting the best possible guidance throughout the home buying process.

## Idea: Emphasize Buyer Representation

What if we addressed the notion that buyers can easily either do most of the work themselves or use the services of the seller's agent by creating marketing content that spells out what a buyer would be missing or risking by not having their own agent representation?

***

## Execution: Social Media Ads (Buyer Representation)

### Ad 1: Your Agent. You First.

If you're ready to buy a home, you're ready for buyer representation. A buyer's agent represents you at every point in the process, helping you evaluate, negotiate, and get the home of your dreams.

_True representation is never double sided._

### Ad 2: Representation Matters

Having a buyer's agent represent you throughout your transaction gives you expertise, experience, and representation in your corner.

_A seller's agent represents the seller._

### Ad 3: What About You?

A seller's agent is always going to put the seller first. Hiring a buyer's agent ensures you get as much representation as they do, from offer to close.

_What about you?_
