_Creating connection with young prospective homeowners_

## Introduction

Our latest research challenges accepted wisdom about what drives first-time homebuyers.

Millennials see homeownership as a physical expression of independence. In an unpredictable world, they crave something fundamental: control over their personal space.

Success belongs to those who connect with aspiring buyers on their terms.

The following marketing insights and executions reach today's buyers, who view ownership differently than their parents did.

## Research Insight: Motivation for Homeownership

**What is the biggest reason you want to buy a home?**

Among aspiring homeowners, **36%** say their top motivation to purchase a home is “I want my own place that I can change how I want,” significantly outranking wealth-building (11%) and concerns over rising housing costs (10%).

| Motivation                                                  | Percentage |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| I want my own place that I can change how I want            | 36%        |
| I’m tired of paying rent and building someone else’s wealth | 22%        |
| I want a place to raise a family                            | 19%        |
| I want to build wealth through ownership                    | 11%        |
| I’m worried the cost of housing will only continue to rise  | 10%        |
| Other                                                       | 2%         |

## Idea: Focus on Freedom, Not Just Financial Growth

What if we spoke to the first-time buyer’s quest for **freedom**, not just financial growth?

By focusing on a first-time buyer's desire for control over their living environment, we can connect emotionally and stand out from financial-focused messaging. This approach transforms renting frustration into ownership ambition.

## Execution: Social Carousel (Live on your terms, not theirs)

**abcrealty**

**Live on your terms, not theirs**

* Own more than just your stuff
* Ready to live without asking ‘Can I?’

**Your walls**\
**Your pets**\
**Your changes**

**Your address**\
**Your investment**\
**Your autonomy**

**You make the rules**

> **ABC Realty:** Your path to homeownership deserves an experienced guide. ABC Realty specializes in first purchases, because freedom shouldn't come with a waiting period.

This messaging approach can be adapted for multiple formats (e.g., social media, web, blog, email, ads) but the point remains consistent. In a sea of undifferentiated real estate ads and marketing, this approach stands out.

## Research Insight: Anticipated Difficulty and Agent Selection

Nearly all non-homeowners (**96%**) expect buying to be difficult. Most (**87%**) don’t have an agent yet, and many (**42%**) prioritize first-time buyer expertise when choosing representation. These buyers value **guidance (41%)** over property-finding services (32%), revealing a preference for advice rather than just transaction assistance.

**How difficult do you anticipate the process of buying a home will be?**

* Very difficult: 35%
* Moderately difficult: 40%
* Somewhat difficult: 21%
* Not difficult at all: 4%

**What would be most likely to make you choose one real estate agent over another?**\
&#xNAN;_(Multi-select question)_

| Factor                              | Percentage |

| Digital savviness                   | 4%         |

## Idea: Demonstrate First-Time Homebuyer Expertise

What if first-time homebuying expertise was purposefully demonstrated as a **unique specialty**?

Dominate your first-time homebuyer market by offering localized education and support. Position yourself as the trusted advisor who understands their journey from the very beginning. Create connections that last generations, not just transactions. Establish relationships before competitors even enter the picture. When buyers are ready, they're more likely to choose you because you invested in their success long before asking for their business.

## Execution: Videos (First-Time Homebuyer Program)

Launch a first-time homebuyer program designed to build trust with aspiring buyers in your local market. Demonstrate your expertise through a series of six short videos that address their questions and concerns while showcasing your proven approach to guiding first-home seekers through the process.

Each video tackles a critical milestone in the homebuying journey. Include success stories from past clients who overcame the same reservations your prospects face today.

| Video Title                                         | Description                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Money-Ready: First Steps to Afford Your Home**    | Financial preparation tailored to our local market, including hidden costs.        |
| **Property Insight: Location Logic: Finding Value** | The 5-Point Check for evaluating properties in our area that reveals true value.   |
| **Your Perfect Spot**                               | Neighborhood factors that impact daily life beyond typical ratings and statistics. |

## Research Insight: Risk Perception

**75%** of potential buyers view homeownership as **risky**, creating a market defined by caution. For **27%** of buyers, these concerns have been deal-killers. Yet **48%** acknowledge the same risks but move forward anyway. The difference isn’t risk perception; it’s **risk navigation**.

**Do you think buying a home is risky?**

* Yes, and this has prevented me from moving forward: 27%
* Yes, but I want to pursue homeownership anyway: 48%
* No, I do not think purchasing a home is risky: 25%

## Idea: Owning the Conversation about Risk

What if we started **owning the conversation about risk**?

The old playbook of minimizing concerns doesn't work with today's aspiring buyers. They know homebuying doesn’t come without risk. They want someone who acknowledges this reality and has a system for navigating through it.

Positioning yourself as the **clear-eyed risk navigator** rather than the eternal optimist creates differentiation. Helping clients understand, evaluate, and mitigate risk delivers the confidence that turns cautious prospects into decisive buyers.

## Execution: Landing Page (Let’s Navigate This Together)

A landing page to customize with your own risk navigation strategies, results, and testimonials.

> **Your concerns about buying a home aren’t irrational. They’re your roadmap to success.**
>
> **Let’s Navigate This Together**
>
> **How to turn legitimate concerns into confident decisions:** It’s time for a reality check, not a sales pitch.

**Here’s what we mean:**

* **We match your specific situation against today’s market conditions.** If the timing's wrong, we'll tell you.
* **Find the problems sellers hide:** Gorgeous listing photos can hide ugly realities. We show you exactly where to look for the expensive issues that marketing materials conveniently skip.
* **Compete without compromise:** Anyone can write a winning offer by stripping away your protection. We secure the home without leaving you exposed when the excitement fades.
* **Future-proof your purchase:** Life changes. Your home should adapt. We’ll help.

This messaging approach can be adapted for multiple formats (e.g., social media, web, blog, email, ads) but the point remains consistent. In a sea of undifferentiated real estate ads and marketing, this approach stands out.

## Research Insight: Questioning Established Wisdom

Young aspiring buyers reject the old playbook. Only **17%** accept traditional advice without question. Their top three rejected assumptions are maximizing their budget (**21%**), the belief that location outweighs all other factors (**16%**), and the notion that renting wastes money (**16%**).

**Which established wisdom about homebuying do you most question or reject?**

| Established Wisdom                                       | Percentage |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| You should max out your home-buying budget               | 21%        |
| “Location, location, location” is everything             | 16%        |
| Renting is throwing money away                           | 16%        |
| You should buy a starter home before your dream home     | 12%        |
| Homeownership is the cornerstone of financial success    | 12%        |
| Real estate appreciates over time                        | 6%         |
| I generally agree with all traditional homebuying advice | 17%        |

## Idea: Ally in Questioning Outdated Rules

What if we became allies in **questioning outdated rules** rather than defending them?

By openly challenging maxims, we can build authentic trust with a generation that values transparency over tradition. This shift in approach creates space for more meaningful client relationships. When we question conventional wisdom alongside buyers instead of trying to overcome their objections, we move from salesperson to trusted advisor.

## Execution: Social Carousel (Challenging Maxims)

**abcrealty**

### Challenging: “BUY AS MUCH HOUSE AS YOU CAN AFFORD”

Many reject this old wisdom. With a maxed budget, you:

* have no buffer for surprises
* sacrifice other goals
* endure monthly stress

> **ABC Realty:** Outdated advice? Not here. Your life, your home, your terms. We'll guide the journey, you decide the destination.

### Challenging: “LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION, IS EVERYTHING”

Today's buyers know:

* remote work shifts priorities
* life needs flexibility
* some areas are overpriced

> **ABC Realty:** Cookie-cutter advice stops here. Old rules don't fit new dreams. We create a path customized to yours.

### Challenging: “RENTING IS THROWING MONEY AWAY”

Context matters. Renting has its place when:

* your job might relocate you
* you prioritize flexibility
* the market is overheated

> **ABC Realty:** There’s no one-size-fits-all advice here. Your real estate move should fit your life, not the other way around. Timing, strategy, and support—all customized precisely for you.

## Research Insight: Biggest Challenge

**22%** of aspiring buyers cite **economic and world uncertainty** as their primary barrier to homeownership—outranking credit issues. Higher-educated buyers are twice as likely to cite uncertainty as a major barrier compared to those with less education (24% vs. 17%).

**What do you see as your biggest challenge in achieving homeownership?**

* Having enough money for a down payment: 33%
* Being able to afford the monthly payment on the kind of home I’d be happy in: 29%
* Uncertainty in the economy and world: 22%
* I have less-than-good credit and worry about my ability to qualify for a mortgage: 14%
* Other: 2%

## Idea: Navigating Uncertainty with Confidence

What if we stopped trying to answer uncertainty with **certainty**?

Today's buyers don't want false promises about the future; they need tools to navigate through it with confidence. What if we acknowledged real anxieties while providing strategies that build resilience into homebuying decisions. Not eliminating risk, but making it manageable through smart planning that works regardless of what tomorrow brings.

## Execution: Video Series (Smart Real Estate in Uncertain Times)

Produce short 2-3 minute videos that bridge market uncertainty and confident decision-making. By demystifying challenges, you establish yourself as a trusted navigator through economic unpredictability, helping clients turn uncertainty into strategic opportunity.

| Video Topic                                  | Key Focus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Financial Flexibility Strategies**         | Highlight specific mortgage products designed for economic uncertainty. Explain buffer fund strategies and how to calculate appropriate reserves. Illustrate the difference between being "house poor" versus financially flexible.                                                                                       |
| **Property Selection for Uncertain Futures** | Explain the importance of buying with multiple future scenarios in mind. Showcase properties with adaptable features (home office potential, income suite options). Explain how to evaluate neighborhood resilience beyond current desirability. Demonstrate the value of energy efficiency for controlling future costs. |
| **Exit Strategy Planning from Day One**      | Show how to evaluate rental potential even if you never plan to be a landlord. Discuss resale considerations that matter most during uncertain markets. Explore strategic renovation choices that maximize future selling options.                                                                                        |
