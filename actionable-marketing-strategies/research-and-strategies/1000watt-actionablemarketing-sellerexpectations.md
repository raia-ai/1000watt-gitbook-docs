_September 2024_

## Introduction and Research Overview

We surveyed over 1,000 consumers who had recently sold a home to get an update on what they know about recent industry changes and their sentiment on agent compensation.

We then asked the top 20% of our consumers who had sold a home a series of questions about their experience going through that process.

We uncovered insights around questions like:

* How is sentiment about how much agents are paid trending?
* How do sellers' expectations align with the reality of their experience?
* What's the "new normal" sellers hire agents to do when selling their home?

While there is much conversation surrounding buyer representation, the other side of the coin merits a revisiting as well. Both are inextricably linked. Crafting a fresh seller engagement strategy as you look ahead to 2025 is an opportunity for advantage. We hope to support you in achieving this.

## Research Methodology

The survey was conducted in September 2024.

We surveyed 1,000 recent home sellers. The goal was to understand their current sentiment and expectations regarding the home-selling process and their agents.

## Key Findings: Seller Expectations vs. Reality

### What Sellers Expect from Agents

Sellers have high expectations for their agents, particularly concerning marketing and pricing strategy.

| Seller Expectation                                                                                   | Reality Check                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Expert Pricing Strategy:** Setting the optimal price from the start.                               | Agents often have to manage unrealistic seller expectations on price.               |
| **High-Quality Marketing:** Professional photos, virtual tours, and compelling listing descriptions. | Sellers often underestimate the cost and effort involved in high-quality marketing. |
| **Negotiation Expertise:** Securing the best possible price and terms.                               | The negotiation process is often more complex and stressful than anticipated.       |
| **Clear Communication:** Regular, transparent updates on showings and feedback.                      | Communication can break down, leading to seller anxiety.                            |

### The New Normal for Agent Services

Sellers are increasingly hiring agents for specific, high-value services:

* **Pricing and Strategy:** Providing a data-driven comparative market analysis (CMA) and guiding the seller through the pricing process.
* **High-Impact Marketing:** Ensuring the property stands out with professional media and targeted campaigns.
* **Negotiation and Transaction Management:** Handling the complexities of contracts, disclosures, and closing.

### Sentiment on Agent Compensation

The conversation around agent compensation is evolving. The data suggests:

* **Awareness of Commission Structure:** Sellers are generally aware of how commissions work, but there is a desire for more transparency and flexibility.
* **Value for Money:** Sellers who perceive high value in their agent's services are more satisfied with the compensation paid.
* **Trend Towards Unbundling:** A small but growing segment of sellers is interested in unbundled services, paying for specific tasks rather than a full-service commission.

## Conclusion and Actionable Insights

The real estate landscape is changing, and agents must adapt their value proposition to meet the evolving expectations of sellers.
