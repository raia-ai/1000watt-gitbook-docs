## Research Insight 1: Risk Mitigation is Key

Our survey of 1,000 recent buyers revealed that **evaluating homes, disclosure reports, and potential issues** was the most valuable service they received from their agent.

In short, you could think of this as “risk mitigation,” and it makes sense: People need a knowledgeable pro to help them make a sound housing decision that they won’t come to regret.

### Most Valuable Service Received from Agent

| Answer                                                                                       | Percentage (%) |

#### Idea: Neutralize the Fear of Making a Mistake

Inventory is scarce. Prices and rates are high. Today’s buyer can’t afford unexpected issues or a purchase they regret. They are stressed and scared of making a mistake. This causes **knowledge fear**.

What if you address that fear head-on, and explain how you can neutralize it, in a social campaign?

## Research Insight 2: The Compensation Conversation

Almost half of recent buyers **did not get an explanation** of how their agent was to be compensated. These same buyers are very easily persuaded that buyers’ representation may not be necessary.

**People don’t value what they don’t understand.**

### Agent Compensation Disclosure

| Did the real estate agent who helped you buy your home explain, up front, how they were to get paid? | Percentage (%) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Yes                                                                                                  | 54.70%         |
| No                                                                                                   | **45.30%**     |

### Buyer Representation in Other Countries

When asked about a model where most homebuyers do not have a real estate agent representing them (like in some countries), buyers responded:

| Answer                                                                 | Percentage (%) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| I think it makes sense and seems simpler than having 2 agents involved | **71.20%**     |
| I think it is a bad idea and leaves the home buyer vulnerable          | 28.30%         |
| Other                                                                  | 0.50%          |

#### Idea: Own the Compensation Conversation

Be the agent, team, or company who **owns the compensation conversation**. Lead with it, unpack it, and explain what people get for it.

If commissions get divorced in the future, every initial buyer meeting will become just as much about compensation as a listing presentation is.

It’s time to get confident in selling **value** now. Issue a public “manifesto” to loudly and proudly articulate your value to buyers.

## Research Insight 3: Reframing Home Search

Less than 10% of recent buyers said **finding homes** was what they valued most from their agent. This percentage gets lower as buyers’ age gets lower.

Among those who questioned their need for an agent, many cited finding the home they bought themselves as the reason for questioning their agent’s value.

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Idea: Highlight Your True Value Beyond Search

What if you **reframed home search** to highlight your true value, and preemptively neutralize buyers who may think “finding my own” home means they didn’t need an agent?
{% endhint %}

### Execution
