**What consumers think, do, and respond to in a post-settlement world.**

_February 2025_

## Introduction

2024's industry reset exposed more than changing patterns. It illuminated paradoxes in consumer behavior—a new "vibe" that demands our attention. Our latest research set out to understand this evolution: Are consumers more careful? More discerning? Have priorities shifted?

The findings are fascinating. While buyers meticulously research everyday purchases, they often entrust their largest financial transaction to an agent without interviewing alternatives. Meanwhile, sellers lose sleep over optimal pricing, yet few connect this anxiety to their choice of representation.

This disconnect between how consumers choose agents and how they should choose them represents both a vulnerability and an opportunity. As consumer sentiment evolves, being remembered isn't enough. Being remarkable is. The marketing tools that follow will help you stand apart by bridging this gap and shifting consumer thinking from 'Who do I know?' to 'Who can prove their value?'

## How to Use Actionable Marketing

The ideas and examples that follow are meant to help you "connect the dots" between insights uncovered in our research and focus groups, ideas derived from them, and execution of those ideas.

You could copy and paste what we have here. But we strongly recommend that you adapt what is here to your brand's style, your market, and your target customer.

Also, we present the executions in specific formats or media, but consider transferring them to whatever is best for your marketing mix. The ideas and much of the copy are platform agnostic.

## Research Insight

**When hiring an agent, 44% of homeowners did not interview more than one person.**

This means that nearly half of all client opportunities are effectively non-competitive. Here lies an opportunity to explain why one of life's biggest transactions deserves more than a single agent evaluation.

### When you hired a real estate agent, did you interview more than one person?

* **33%** - Yes
* **44%** - No
* **22%** - I did not use a real estate agent

By inviting and encouraging comparison, skilled agents can differentiate themselves in a crowded market and attract clients who are the best fit for their expertise and approach.

## Idea

As an agent, broker, or team lead, you can't increase the number of transactions in your market, but that doesn't mean you can't increase your opportunities.

What if we could help people see how risky it is to not compare and vet agents? Let's show them it's an opportunity cost. A paradox.

We vet things all the time of much less significance. Why skip the homework on a six-figure transaction? Too much is riding on the right choice.

Teaching clients to carefully select an agent isn't just smart business - it's protecting their future. Let's drive awareness to this and show what professional representation truly means.

Then, you can follow-up with content educating them on the most important agent skills and services to weigh and how you stand apart.

Any skilled professional should feel confident inviting comparison.

## Execution: Long Form Content

**Adaptable for eNewsletter, Social Media, Advertorial, Blog, Web, etc.**

### Look familiar?

Let's examine our research habits that shape purchase decisions:

**$80,000 RV:**

* 3 hrs online reviews
* 2 hrs photo gallery review
* 3 hrs comparison test drives
* 2 hrs consumer report reviews

**$800,000 Home:**

* 1x 30 min call to my uncle's real estate agent friend

**$80 Coffee Maker:**

* 1 hr online reviews

**$800 Couch:**

* 1 hr online reviews
* 1 hr feature comparisons
* 1 hr in-store comfort & fit evaluation

Microscopic diligence for small buys, yet blind trust for transformative investments?

Let's break the blind trust cycle. Interview more than one agent. Give your investment the diligence it deserves.

Ask me about my track record for maximizing client outcomes.

## Execution: Social Carousel (Option 1)

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Slide 1

**Your cousin's agent ≠ Your clear best choice**
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Slide 2

**The neighbor's son ≠ Local market expert**
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Slide 3

#### Slide 3

**Wife's tennis partner ≠ Tough negotiator**
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Slide 4

**Friend of a friend ≠ Friend of your investment**
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Slide 5

**Choose expertise, not convenience.**

Your biggest asset deserves better.

_Beyond connections. Beyond convenience. Hard-earned wisdom and real wins._
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Execution: Social Carousel (Option 2)

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Slide 1: Expertise ≠ Acquaintance

Belonging to your book club doesn't ensure real estate proficiency.

**Ask about negotiation skills, not social affiliations.**
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Slide 2: Expertise ≠ Family

Knowing them since childhood doesn't mean they'll get you top dollar.

**Ask about marketing plans, not family ties.**
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Slide 3: Expertise ≠ Presence

Seeing their logo on your commute doesn't equate to standout service.

**Ask for references, not billboard counts.**
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Slide 4: Final Message

Don't let convenience drive your most important financial decision. Vet multiple real estate agents to find the expert right for you.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Execution: Social Carousel (Option 3)

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Slide 1

**The closest hairstylist isn't always your best choice.**

Nor is hiring the nearest real estate agent simply because it's "convenient".
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Slide 2

**A "family friend" contractor isn't always your best choice.**

Nor is hiring your friend's uncle as a real estate agent because he "seems trustworthy".
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Slide 3

**A "friend with a camera" may not be the best choice for professional headshots.**

Nor is hiring your golf buddy as your real estate agent because he "looks professional".
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Slide 4

**A "niece who codes a little" may not be the best choice for your website.**

Nor is hiring your son's coach as your real estate agent because he's a "really nice guy".
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Slide 5: Final Message

Not all help is created equal. Skill beats convenience. Don't settle for any real estate agent. Interview. Compare. Choose wisely and protect your biggest investment.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Research Insight: Agent Value Perception

**Generally speaking, do you think real estate agents are worth the fees they are paid?**

* **55%** - Yes
* **45%** - No

Consumer skepticism about agent fees continues to persist, with 45% questioning the value provided. Last year's headlines have reinforced this perception, signaling an opportunity for you to proactively reframe your value proposition and demonstrate tangible benefits to clients.

## Idea: Demonstrating Value

What if your marketing clearly exposed that buying or selling a home – a complex, high-stakes transaction – requires a highly trained expert who delivers measurable value that meets, if not exceeds, their fees?

What if it showed how your credentials deliver significant financial and strategic advantages in the precise service areas clients value most?

## Execution: Social Carousel (Value Proposition)

### Slide 1

**Nobody brags about finding the cheapest surgeon.**

### Slide 2

**Or the cheapest college education.**

Or engagement ring.

### Slide 3

**Some things are worth investing in.**

Like the expert handling one of life's biggest transactions.

### Final Message

Your real estate agent isn't an expense - they're an investment in expert guidance that pays dividends. Let us show you how highly trained agents translate to real financial results.
