# actionablemarketing seizingfallingrates

**August 2024**

## Introduction

This edition of **Actionable Marketing** is designed to help you look ahead and anticipate what's next.

For over two years, many buyers and sellers have felt "locked-up" and "locked-out" due to rising interest rates. Now, many are unlocked.

We sought to answer questions like:

* What is the consumer sentiment around rates?
* How can you help clients navigate the historic shift in rates?
* How much will rates need to fall before more buyers can enter the market?

While much of the industry is focused on navigating settlement changes, we want to help you look ahead.

## The Big Idea: The Falling Rate Opportunity

The ideas and much of the copy are platform-agnostic. Consider transforming them to whatever is best for your marketing mix. The ideas and much of the copy are platform-agnostic.

### Idea: The "Move-Up" Buyer

The average payment on a $500K home has dropped by **$670/month** since last fall.

The average payment on a $750K home has dropped by **$820/month** since last fall.

The average payment on a $1M home has dropped by **$1,010/month** since last fall.

#### Execution: Social Carousel

Handle: **@abcrealty**

Post headline: Looking to "move up?"

Carousel bullets:

* The average payment on a $500K home has dropped by $670/mo since last fall.
* The average payment on a $750K home has dropped by $820/mo.
* The average payment on a $1M home has dropped by $1,010/mo.

Caption: If you bought at a different rate for a different price, and have felt “locked-in”, let me know in the comments. This is a conversation I’m having a lot with my clients and I’d love to learn where you’re at, too.

### Idea: The "Locked-In" Seller

You could be paying about **$700 less per month** with the recent rate drops. If you haven't done so, you could absolutely be refinancing, but this also means **added buying power** if you want to move up.

Reach out if you'd like to talk more about that math, and if your goals are still the same as when we last spoke.

### Idea: The "Rate-Drop" Email

This is a great opportunity to connect with clients where they are at, which will make it easier to capture and hold their attention.

Subject: Your mortgage payment could be lower.

Body (template):

{% code title="Email template" %}

```
{% endcode %}
{% endstep %}

### Idea: The "Insurance Cost" Angle

What if you were able to assist people in your area thinking about moving due to **rising insurance costs**? Or simply establishing yourself as the agent, team, or company that understands this issue and how to address it?

#### Execution: Social Post / Reel Script

Script / Caption:

{% code title="Social/Reel script" %}
