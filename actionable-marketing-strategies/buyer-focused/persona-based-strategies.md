## A Persona-Based Campaign for First-Time Buyers

**MAY 2025**

***

## How to Use This Guide

The ideas and examples that follow are meant to help you "connect the dots" between insights uncovered in our research and focus groups, ideas derived from them, and execution of those ideas.

You could copy and paste what we have here. But we strongly recommend that you adapt what is here to your brand's style, your market, and your target customer.

Also, we present the executions in specific formats or media, but consider transferring them to whatever is best for your marketing mix. The ideas and much of the copy are platform agnostic.

***

## Why This Matters

First-time buyers need help, especially those who are young. We also know that the best marketing reflects the targeted audience back onto itself as a demonstration of understanding.

Yet few practitioners say, publicly, "Yes, I am the one prepared to help you, and here's how."

First-timers are looking for this signal. We know this because they told us.

In our April 2025 research report on aspiring young homebuyers, **"Expertise in first time home buying"** was the #1 factor people said they would use to choose one agent over another.

This is a big missed opportunity.

Be the agent, team, or brokerage that says, loud and clear, "We can help."

We used that insight, along with what buyers told us they need, to shape a first-time buyer marketing approach that says: we see you, and we're prepared to help.

We suggest thinking of what follows as a campaign, not a one-off. It's designed to be the first move in a series you can build on, with new drops each quarter all geared toward this audience. That's how you stay relevant, build trust, and show up consistently.

But as with any 1000WATT tool, make it yours. Adjust the format, tone, and rollout to fit your brand, your market, and your goals.

***

## The Opportunity

**What if we could leverage research insights to engage skeptical buyers, turn curiosity into connection, and build deeper value and trust?**

***

## The Strategy: Build Trust with a Quiz

**Self-discovery quizzes build trust, segment buyers, and fuel personalized engagement**

This isn't just a quiz. It's a strategy shift.

When people feel seen, they show interest. They trust. They believe in possibility.

### Why Quizzes Work

* **96% of participants complete online quizzes** (BuzzFeed)
* **Quizzes are shared nearly 2,000 times on average** (BuzzSumo)
* **81% of marketers say interactive content is more effective than static** (Forbes)
* **Over 3.6 million leads generated via LeadQuizzes**

## Build the Quiz: Sample Questions + Persona Logic

### How the quiz works (behind the scenes):

Each answer is tied to one of three core buyer personas. The user never sees this mapping — it's for you to understand what's driving them and tailor content or guidance accordingly. You can keep the quiz short and simple or expand to 4-6 questions for a more nuanced read.

### Personas:

* **Freedom Seeker** – motivated by autonomy and flexibility
* **Nest Builder** – focused on family, roots, and stability
* **Smart Strategist** – driven by logic, timing, and financial sense

### Sample Questions:

**Q: What's the real reason you want to own a home?**

A. I want a space that's fully mine. No rules, no landlord.\
→ _(Freedom Seeker)_

B. I want to build a stable, long-term place for my family.\
→ _(Nest Builder)_

C. It's a smart financial move better than renting long-term.\
→ _(Smart Strategist)_

**Q: What worries you most about homeownership?**

A. Feeling stuck or locked into something I can't change.\
→ _(Freedom Seeker)_

B. Making the wrong choice for my family's future.\
→ _(Nest Builder)_

C. Overpaying or buying at the wrong time.\
→ _(Smart Strategist)_

_The personas in parentheses are not shown to the quiz taker. They're here to guide your setup and interpretation._
