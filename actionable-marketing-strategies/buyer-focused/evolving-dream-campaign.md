Turning insights into action

Creating connection with young prospective homeowners

April 2025

## Introduction

Our latest research challenges accepted wisdom about what drives first-time homebuyers.

Millennials see homeownership as a physical expression of independence. In an unpredictable world, they crave something fundamental: control over their personal space. They understand the financial risks yet move forward, valuing freedom over traditional investment returns. This priority shift informs how we navigate the housing market of tomorrow.

Success belongs to those who connect with aspiring buyers on their terms.

The following marketing insights and executions reach today's buyers, who view ownership differently than their parents did.

## How to Use Actionable Marketing

The ideas and examples that follow are meant to help you "connect the dots" between insights uncovered in our research and focus groups, ideas derived from them, and execution of those ideas.

You could copy and paste what we have here. But we strongly recommend that you adapt what is here to your brand's style, your market, and your target customer.

Also, we present the executions in specific formats or media, but consider transferring them to whatever is best for your marketing mix. The ideas and much of the copy are platform agnostic.

## Research Insight #1: The Quest for Personal Control

### Key Finding

Among aspiring homeowners, **36%** say their top motivation to purchase a home is "I want my own place that I can change how I want," significantly outranking wealth-building (11%) and concerns over rising housing costs (10%).

### Survey Results: What is the biggest reason you want to buy a home?

| Motivation                                                  | Percentage |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| I want my own place that I can change how I want            | **36%**    |
| I'm tired of paying rent and building someone else's wealth | 22%        |
| I want a place to raise a family                            | 19%        |
| I want to build wealth through ownership                    | 11%        |
| I'm worried the cost of housing will only continue to rise  | 10%        |
| Other                                                       | 2%         |

### Marketing Idea

**What if we spoke to the first-time buyer's quest for freedom, not just financial growth?**

By focusing on a first-time buyer's desire for control over their living environment, we can connect emotionally and stand out from financial-focused messaging. This approach transforms renting frustration into ownership ambition.

### Execution Example: Social Media Carousel

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Live on your terms, not theirs

Own more than just your stuff
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Ready to live without asking 'Can I?'

* Your walls
* Your pets
* Your changes
* Your autonomy

You make the rules
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Your address

Your investment
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### ABC Realty

Your path to homeownership deserves an experienced guide. ABC Realty specializes in first purchases, because freedom shouldn't come with a waiting period.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Implementation Notes

This messaging approach can be adapted for multiple formats (e.g., social media, web, blog, email, ads) but the point remains consistent. In a sea of undifferentiated real estate ads and marketing, this approach stands out.

## Research Insight #2: The Need for Expert Guidance

### Key Finding

Nearly all non-homeowners (**96%**) expect buying to be difficult. Most (87%) don't have an agent yet, and many (42%) prioritize first-time buyer expertise when choosing representation. These buyers value guidance (41%) over property-finding services (32%), revealing a preference for advice rather than just transaction assistance.

### Survey Results: How difficult do you anticipate the process of buying a home will be?

| Difficulty Level     | Percentage |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| Very difficult       | **35%**    |
| Moderately difficult | **40%**    |
| Somewhat difficult   | 21%        |
| Not difficult at all | 4%         |

### Agent Selection Criteria

What would be most likely to make you choose one real estate agent over another?

_Multi-select question. Percentages calculated by dividing each answer by total unique respondents._

| Selection Factor                       | Percentage |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Expertise in first-time homebuying** | **42%**    |
| Online reviews/reputation              | 32%        |
| Personal recommendation                | 31%        |
| Availability/responsiveness            | 31%        |
| Communication style                    | 27%        |
| Negotiation skills                     | 26%        |
| Knowledge of specific neighborhoods    | 25%        |
| Personality/connection                 | 25%        |
| Digital savviness                      | 4%         |

### Marketing Idea

**What if first-time homebuying expertise was purposefully demonstrated as a unique specialty?**

Dominate your first-time homebuyer market by offering localized education and support. Position yourself as the trusted advisor who understands their journey from the very beginning. Create connections that last generations, not just transactions. Establish relationships before competitors even enter the picture. When buyers are ready, they're more likely to choose you because you invested in their success long before asking for their business.

### Execution Example: Educational Video Series

Launch a first-time homebuyer program designed to build trust with aspiring buyers in your local market. Demonstrate your expertise through a series of six short videos that address their questions and concerns while showcasing your proven approach to guiding first-home seekers through the process.

## Research Insight #3: Risk Navigation Over Risk Denial

### Key Finding

**75%** of potential buyers view homeownership as risky, creating a market defined by caution. For 27% of buyers, these concerns have been deal-killers. Yet 48% acknowledge the same risks but move forward anyway. The difference isn't risk perception; it's risk navigation.

### Survey Results: Do you think buying a home is risky?

| Response                                           | Percentage |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Yes, but I want to pursue homeownership anyway     | **48%**    |
| Yes, and this has prevented me from moving forward | **27%**    |
| No, I do not think purchasing a home is risky      | 25%        |

### Marketing Idea

**What if we started owning the conversation about risk?**

The old playbook of minimizing concerns doesn't work with today's aspiring buyers. They know homebuying doesn't come without risk. They want someone who acknowledges this reality and has a system for navigating through it.

Positioning yourself as the clear-eyed risk navigator rather than the eternal optimist creates differentiation. Helping clients understand, evaluate, and mitigate risk delivers the confidence that turns cautious prospects into decisive buyers.

### Execution Example: Risk Navigation Landing Page

Create a landing page to customize with your own risk navigation strategies, results, and testimonials.

#### Headline:

**Your concerns about buying a home aren't irrational. They're your roadmap to success.**

#### Subheading:

**Let's Navigate This Together**

How to turn legitimate concerns into confident decisions: It's time for a reality check, not a sales pitch.

#### Key Service Areas:

**Reality Check First**\
We match your specific situation against today's market conditions. If the timing's wrong, we'll tell you.

**Find the Problems Sellers Hide**\
Gorgeous listing photos can hide ugly realities. We show you exactly where to look for the expensive issues that marketing materials conveniently skip.

**Compete Without Compromise**\
Anyone can write a winning offer by stripping away your protection. We secure the home without leaving you exposed when the excitement fades.

**Future-Proof Your Purchase**\
Life changes. Your home should adapt. We'll help.

## Research Insight #4: Questioning Traditional Homebuying Wisdom

### Key Finding

Young aspiring buyers reject the old playbook. Only **17%** accept traditional advice without question. Their top three rejected assumptions are maximizing their budget (21%), the belief that location outweighs all other factors (16%), and the notion that renting wastes money (16%).

### Survey Results: Which established wisdom about homebuying do you most question or reject?

| Traditional Wisdom                                           | Percentage Who Reject |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| **You should max out your home-buying budget**               | **21%**               |
| "Location, location, location" is everything                 | **16%**               |
| Renting is throwing money away                               | **16%**               |
| You should buy a starter home before your dream home         | 12%                   |
| Homeownership is the cornerstone of financial success        | 12%                   |
| Real estate appreciates over time                            | 6%                    |
| **I generally agree with all traditional homebuying advice** | **17%**               |

### Marketing Idea

**What if we became allies in questioning outdated rules rather than defending them?**

By openly challenging maxims, we can build authentic trust with a generation that values transparency over tradition. This shift in approach creates space for more meaningful client relationships. When we question conventional wisdom alongside buyers instead of trying to overcome their objections, we move from salesperson to trusted advisor.

### Execution Examples: Social Media Carousels

Carousel: Challenging "Max Out Your Budget"

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### "BUY AS MUCH HOUSE AS YOU CAN AFFORD"

_- Says the old playbook_
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Many reject this old wisdom.

**They're right.**

With a maxed budget, you:

* have no buffer for surprises
* sacrifice other goals
* endure monthly stress
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### ABC Realty

Outdated advice? Not here. Your life, your home, your terms. We'll guide the journey, you decide the destination.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Carousel: Challenging "Location, Location, Location"

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### "LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION, IS EVERYTHING"

_Is it though?_
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Today's buyers know:

* remote work shifts priorities
* life needs flexibility
* some areas are overpriced
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Want straight talk about your needs?

**ABC Realty**

Cookie-cutter advice stops here. Old rules don't fit new dreams. We create a path customized to yours.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Carousel: Challenging "Renting is Throwing Money Away"

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### "RENTING IS THROWING MONEY AWAY"

_Time for a reality check._
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Context matters. Renting has its place when:

* your job might relocate you
* you prioritize flexibility
* the market is overheated
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Looking for reality-based housing advice?

**ABC Realty**

There's no one-size-fits-all advice here. Your real estate move should fit your life, not the other way around. Timing, strategy, and support—all customized precisely for you.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Research Insight #5: Navigating Economic and World Uncertainty

### Key Finding

**22%** of aspiring buyers cite economic and world uncertainty as their primary barrier to homeownership—outranking credit issues. Higher-educated buyers are twice as likely to cite uncertainty as a major barrier compared to those with less education (24% vs. 17%).

### Survey Results: What do you see as your biggest challenge in achieving homeownership?

| Challenge                                                                         | Percentage |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Having enough money for a down payment                                            | **33%**    |
| Being able to afford the monthly payment on the kind of home I'd be happy in      | **29%**    |
| **Uncertainty in the economy and world**                                          | **22%**    |
| I have less-than-good credit and worry about my ability to qualify for a mortgage | 14%        |
| Other                                                                             | 2%         |

### Marketing Idea

**What if we stopped trying to answer uncertainty with certainty?**

Today's buyers don't want false promises about the future; they need tools to navigate through it with confidence. What if we acknowledged real anxieties while providing strategies that build resilience into homebuying decisions. Not eliminating risk, but making it manageable through smart planning that works regardless of what tomorrow brings.

### Execution Example: Video Series - "Smart Real Estate in Uncertain Times"

Produce short 2-3 minute videos that bridge market uncertainty and confident decision-making. By demystifying challenges, you establish yourself as a trusted navigator through economic unpredictability, helping clients turn uncertainty into strategic opportunity.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Financial Flexibility Strategies

* Highlight specific mortgage products designed for economic uncertainty
* Explain buffer fund strategies and how to calculate appropriate reserves
* Illustrate the difference between being "house poor" versus financially flexible
* Feature client testimony about how financial flexibility helped them navigate a life change post-purchase
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Property Selection for Uncertain Future

* Showcase properties with adaptable features (home office potential, income suite options)
* Explain how to evaluate neighborhood resilience beyond current desirability
* Demonstrate the value of energy efficiency for controlling future costs
* Explore zoning considerations for future property modifications
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Exit Strategy Planning from Day One

* Explain the importance of buying with multiple future scenarios in mind
* Show how to evaluate rental potential even if you never plan to be a landlord
* Discuss resale considerations that matter most during uncertain markets
* Explore strategic renovation choices that maximize future selling options
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
