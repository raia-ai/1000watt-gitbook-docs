Turning insights into action\

## Introduction

The real estate world changed on August 17th, nearly three months ago.

The industry responded. New forms, new processes, and new conversations with consumers. While there have been struggles, bad actors, and a fair bit of anxiety, most met the challenge ably.

At this point, in the wake of this shock, most homebuyers are at least slightly aware of the changes the settlement brought about. More of them are now inclined to think that real estate agents are paid too much, but the basic need—to navigate a complex, high-risk transaction successfully—remains.

How do we meet that need most effectively today and into the future? This is the question that motivated our survey of 1,000 recent buyers. If buyers demand value from an agent, where do they see that value lying? What do they want most from an agent?

This edition of Actionable Marketing is based on the answers we received, and is offered to help you meet buyer expectations better than your competitors.

## How to Use Actionable Marketing

The ideas and examples that follow are meant to help you "connect the dots" between insights uncovered in our research and focus groups, ideas derived from them, and execution of those ideas.

You could copy and paste what we have here. But we strongly recommend that you adapt what is here to your brand's style, your market, and your target customer.

Also, we present the executions in specific formats or media, but consider transferring them to whatever is best for your marketing mix. The ideas and much of the copy are platform agnostic.

## Research Insight: Perception of Agent Compensation

### Buyers are now more likely to think that agents are overpaid

Generally speaking, do you think real estate agents are paid too much?

Over the past two years, 40-45% of consumers held the view that agents are overpaid. Now, following the implementation of the settlement, 57% hold this view.

All answers:

* **Yes:** 57%
* **No:** 43%

Those who know more about the settlement are even more likely to hold this view.

Those who claim to know "a lot" or "some" about the settlement:

* **Yes:** 63%
* **No:** 37%

### Idea: Respond with Confidence and Transparency

What if you responded to this new reality with confidence and transparency rather than defensiveness? What if you built a campaign around this?

A challenge to compensation is not an objection to overcome, but an invitation to explain what clients get in return.

### Execution: Landing Page

ABC Realty

Our fee for buyer representation—and what you get for it.

#### How we get paid

Our buyer clients pay us a fee equal to \_\_\_% of the price of the home they buy.

So, for example, if you buy a $500,000 home, our fee is $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

## Research Insight: Transaction Complexity

### Almost a third of people who have been through a home purchase transaction recently found the process more complicated than expected

Was the process of selling your home more or less complicated than you expected?

* **It was more complicated than I expected:** 28%
* **It was about like I expected:** 57%
* **It was less complicated than I expected:** 15%

It's always bad to "surprise on the down side". But it's especially risky now on the buy side.

### Idea: Embrace Reality and Show Preparedness

What if you embraced the reality that unexpected things do happen when buying a home, but showed people how you're prepared to handle these things by giving specific examples?

Imagine a brochure (print, electronic, or even in the form of a landing page) titled "Preparing for the Unexpected."

### Execution: Brochure (Online or Offline)

Expecting the Unexpected

Helping you navigate the homebuying journey

Our promise to you isn't that challenges won't arise, or that absolutely everything will go as expected. Our promise is that we will be prepared to handle whatever happens with skill and smarts.

Here are some examples of how we've done that, so you can see what that means.

Buying a home is a big deal—financially and emotionally. There's a lot at stake. And at some point in the process, it's likely you'll face a tough decision, a challenge, or something you didn't expect.

#### The home I'm under contract to buy didn't appraise!

This means the amount of money you offered is more than the appraiser hired by your lender says it's worth. This happens occasionally, and there are a few things we can do in this situation...

#### The seller did not disclose an easement on their property!

An easement is a legal right to use someone else's property for a specific purpose (a driveway, access, etc.). These can pop up on a title report once you're already under contract to buy a property. We can handle this in a few ways...

This is just an illustration of the idea. We suggest meeting with your team to identify things that can go sideways, in your market, with your clients, and how you deal with them.

## Research Insight: Agent Value Perception

### 26% of recent buyers felt their agent was not worth the money they paid

Did you feel like what you got from the real estate agent you used to sell your home was worth the money you paid them?

* **Yes, and then some:** 19%
* **Yes:** 56%
* **Not really:** 21%
* **Definitely not:** 5%

26% of our recent buyers felt that their agent was either "not really" or "definitely not" worth the money they paid them. When we asked these people why they felt that way, a feeling that "I did the work myself" was one of the most common responses.

Agent's Limited Contribution: Several users reported they did most of the work themselves.

> "I found the house myself and the negotiation was okay."

> "I found my home on my own."

### Idea: Clarify Roles and Educate on Value

What if you messaged around two points to value the agent's role:

* Who does what in a transaction, and how
* What doesn't happen in a real estate transaction as a result of good representation

This could take the form of video/reel, an email, a blog post... whatever. The point is to anticipate and educate around a possible point of misunderstanding. In our example that follows, we show what this could look like in social postings.

### Execution: Social Posts

### Post Series 1: Role Clarification

"Wait, is it my job or my agent's job to find me a house?"

We hear this a lot, and the answer is "both". Our clients love the big home search apps, and we love scouring the MLS and hunting for off-market properties. It's a collab!

"If I find the home myself, what did my agent actually do?"

Sometimes we find the perfect place, sometimes our clients find it online. Either way, where we really earn our keep comes after "find".

***

ABC Realty\
"How do I know I got what I paid for from my agent?"

Our clients understand that we handle a hundred details, but they measure our highest value in our fierce protection of their pocketbook and peace of mind.
{% endstep %}

### Post Series 2: Value Education

ABC Realty\
When buying a home, what doesn't happen is as important as what does.

Here's a secret: Many problems that arise in a real estate transaction only happen because the agent wasn't paying attention. You deserve better.

ABC Realty\
Our work on your home purchase began years ago.

The value we bring to the table for our buyer has been built on years of experience advocating for, and protecting, our clients' interests.

ABC Realty\
Most buyers who hire a bad agent never know it.

Many buyers "love" their agent, but remain unaware of what their agent _didn't_ do to protect their interests and money.
